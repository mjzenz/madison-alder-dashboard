The Madison Plan Commission held a virtual meeting on July 7, 2025, approving several significant housing developments and advancing key "Housing Forward" zoning initiatives aimed at streamlining residential development across the city.

#### Major Housing Approvals

##### Northport Drive Multi-Family Development

[Legistar 88336](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7398856&GUID=FC21DB45-57F6-4456-80F7-A0F2D2B46CCE) 

![Northport Drive Development](resources/PC_2025-07-07_1.jpg){#PC_2025-07-07_1}


The Commission approved on the consent agenda a four-story, 80-unit apartment building at 709 Northport Drive in a planned multi-use site that will also contain a proposed four-story, 24-unit apartment building and an existing place of worship. The project included approval of a certified survey map for the lot split adjacent to the church.


##### City View Drive Mixed-Use Complex

[Legistar 88551](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7421256&GUID=F7EB4271-20CF-4127-B957-A28D45CB7B0E)

![City View Drive Development](resources/PC_2025-07-07_2.jpg){#PC_2025-07-07_2}

The Commission approved a large-scale development at 2222-2304 City View Drive consisting of multiple buildings of various sizes, including a four-story mixed-use building containing approximately 4,600 square feet of commercial space and 60 apartments, plus a four-story 47-unit apartment building, a five-story 39-unit apartment building, and a five-story 40-unit apartment building. The project also included approval of a certified survey map.

#### Reiland Grove Subdivision

##### Controversial Residential Development

[Legistar 88449](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7418519&GUID=2EA3BA1C-FA59-4662-BD13-26FBE53A57AC) & [Legistar 88206](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7418519&GUID=2EA3BA1C-FA59-4662-BD13-26FBE53A57AC)

The more controversial item involved a residential subdivision by Veridian on current farmland at Commercial Avenue and Reiner Road. The Commission unanimously recommended approval of both the rezoning and preliminary plat for "Reiland Grove" to the Common Council.

![Reiland Grove Subdivision](resources/PC_2025-07-07_3.jpg){#PC_2025-07-07_3}

**Community Concerns:**
One public speaker expressed concern that this is entirely a residential, car-oriented development without any commercial component. The speaker also raised issues about the width of streets and alleys in the development, noting a 100-foot right-of-way that may allow for high speeds without parked cars.

![Example Streets in Right of Way](resources/PC_2025-07-07_8.jpg){#PC_2025-07-07_8}

**Developer Response:**
The developer noted that the city's comprehensive plan calls for commercial development south of the residential area. Both the developer and staff indicated that commercial development often follows after residential demand is established.

![City Plan for the Area - subdivision in red square](resources/PC_2025-07-07_6.jpg){#PC_2025-07-07_6}

**Project Evolution:**
The city required the developer to relocate several residential lots around the proposed city park because they were thought to encroach on park uses, resulting in a larger public park. The development also includes a private park. The preliminary plat includes several outlots in the southeast designated for future development, which may include multifamily and/or mixed-use components.

![Original Park Design](resources/PC_2025-07-07_10.jpg){#PC_2025-07-07_10}

**Development Timeline:**
The subdivision will be developed over the next 15 years, with specific street design details to be determined later. Currently, only the geometry of lots and street right-of-ways are being established.

#### Housing Forward Zoning Initiatives

The Commission advanced three major zoning changes under the "Housing Forward" initiative, all receiving unanimous recommendations for approval at the following week's Common Council meeting:

##### Duplexes in All Residential Zones

[Legistar 88736](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97946)

![Duplex Zoning Change](resources/PC_2025-07-07_12.jpg){#PC_2025-07-07_12}

The Commission recommended allowing duplexes in all single-family zones, though not in Planned Development (PD) zones. This change builds on recent modifications to duplex policies that allowed more configurations of two-unit buildings, with some potentially created through internal conversions of existing homes.

##### Flag Lot Development

[Legistar 88735](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97945)

The Commission approved changes to facilitate "flag lot" divisions, which break a single large lot into multiple lots by extending a thin driveway portion to the street with the new lot placed at the rear. The changes will decrease the required width of the driveway portion, standardize lot size and setbacks, and streamline the approval process.

![Flag Lot Changes](resources/PC_2025-07-07_16.jpg){#PC_2025-07-07_16}

Commissioner Guequierre raised questions about potential conflicts with existing private covenants. Staff explained that the city does not track private agreements, but legal action could be taken if such covenants exist and are violated.

##### Downtown Apartment Streamlining

[Legistar 88737](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97947)

The Commission recommended allowing more medium-sized apartment buildings to be built by right (without Plan Commission review) in downtown districts:
- In DC and UMX districts: increase height limit by right from 4 to 6 stories
- DR1 district: increase by-right units from 4 to 12 units
- DR2 district: increase by-right units from 8 to 36 units

![DC and UMX Zone Changes](resources/PC_2025-07-07_20.jpg){#PC_2025-07-07_20}

![DR1 Zone Changes](resources/PC_2025-07-07_21.jpg){#PC_2025-07-07_18}

![DR2 Zone Changes](resources/PC_2025-07-07_22.jpg){#PC_2025-07-07_22}


**Commission Concerns:**
Commissioner Heck expressed concern about how buildings adjacent to landmarks would be reviewed, noting this represents another policy that appears to empower the Landmarks Commission. Commissioner Solheim questioned what would happen if Landmarks requested changes to a permitted building and who would review such decisions if not the Plan Commission.

Staff explained that for downtown buildings permitted by right, Landmarks serves in an advisory capacity to the Urban Design Commission (UDC) and staff for approvals "using the standards that are in the ordinance." Landmarks makes final decisions for landmark buildings and those in historic districts, while UDC decides matters for buildings adjacent to landmarks.

Commissioner Heck requested that staff map out the roles of various commissions in approving apartments that become permitted uses to avoid future misunderstandings about Landmarks/UDC authority.

#### Additional Approvals

##### Cemetery Expansion
[Legistar 88555](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97791) - Conditional use for crypt addition to Saint Bernard of Clairvaux Cathedral at 2438-2462 Atwood Avenue

##### Additional Survey Maps and Zoning
[Legistar 88557](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97793) - Certified Survey Map for property at 1626 and 1634 Baker Avenue

[Legistar 88717](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97927) - Zoning assignment for property at 60 White Oaks Lane

The meeting demonstrated the Commission's continued focus on expanding housing options while addressing concerns about the evolving roles of various city commissions in the development review process.


### June 23, 2025

By Michael Zenz with the help of Claude AI

Also [live-tweeted on Bluesky by ZENZ](https://bsky.app/profile/therealzenz.bsky.social/post/3lscqlgx5xc2e)

[Official Minutes](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=M&ID=1235180&GUID=1AE942D8-20A9-4784-A074-0C0E92305B79)

The Madison Plan Commission held a virtual meeting on June 23, 2025, approving several significant development projects including a contentious 93-unit affordable housing development that sparked debate about comprehensive planning and residential safety standards.

#### Major Affordable Housing Approval

##### Verona Road Mixed-Use Development

[Legistar 87879](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7296853&GUID=2A23EFFC-AF18-4493-866B-086652874422)

The Commission unanimously approved a conditional use for a five-story mixed-use building at 4506-4514 Verona Road containing 324 square feet of commercial space and 93 apartments. This project became the evening's most controversial item due to concerns about comprehensive plan consistency and pedestrian safety.

![Verona Road Development](resources/PC_2025-06-23_2.jpg){#PC_2025-06-23_2}

**Project Details:**
- 45 one-bedroom units
- 23 two-bedroom units  
- 25 two-bedroom units
- Approximately 1 parking space per unit (underground)
- 324 square feet of rentable commercial space
- WHEDA-funded affordable housing
- On-site amenities include play area, community room, and case-management space

**Staff Concerns:**
The item was referred from the previous meeting, with staff expressing concerns that the location is designated as general commercial in the comprehensive plan and may be inconsistent with residential use. Staff noted the site is designed for big-box retail development, and the comprehensive plan calls for commercial rather than residential use.

![Verona Road Site](resources/PC_2025-06-23_1.jpg){#PC_2025-06-23_1}

Madison Police Department expressed skepticism about pedestrian safety and anticipated more service calls. Routes to nearby parks require crossing Verona Road, and the frontage road carries approximately 3,500 cars per day.

**Applicant Response:**
The developer addressed traffic and highway proximity concerns by describing sound mitigation measures, sheltered open spaces, and walkability to parks and groceries. They assured that the shared driveway with University Book Store would not be affected.

![Nearby Bus Routes](resources/PC_2025-06-23_7.jpg){#PC_2025-06-23_7}

![Nearby Bike Routes](resources/PC_2025-06-23_8.jpg){#PC_2025-06-23_8}

**Community Opposition:**
The Orchard Ridge Neighborhood Association, located west of the site, expressed concerns about traffic safety in the area. Some residents characterized the placement of low-income housing in this location as "modern redlining" and creating a "polluted ghetto." One resident specifically mentioned concerns about increased police calls associated with the low-income development.

**Planning Discussion:**
The project highlighted tensions between housing needs and comprehensive planning. While the site is already zoned Commercial Center (CC), which allows residential use through conditional use permits, the comprehensive plan designates the area for general commercial use. Staff noted that conditional uses don't necessarily need to be consistent with the comprehensive plan, but the plan serves as evidence for appropriateness.

A key issue was the developer's use of minimal commercial space (~350 square feet) to classify the project as "mixed use," thereby exceeding the 50-unit limit typically allowed in the zone - a strategy described as exploiting a zoning code loophole to enable more housing.

**Commission Decision:**
Chair Gnam questioned the applicant's walk time calculations, noting her own 12-minute walk to a park the applicant claimed was 4 minutes away.

Alder Field questioned why general commercial areas shouldn't allow housing when mixed-use areas do. Staff explained that recent area plan changes from mixed-use to general commercial were made due to proximity to freeways or large commercial developments inconsistent with housing.

Alder Guequierre moved to approve the conditional use, stating that walking times to amenities and the Southwest Path support housing at this location. He noted that he personally walked the area and found pedestrian access "very good" without "a scary amount of traffic." He suggested that big-box retail patterns are changing nationally and locally, and that the Southwest Area Plan might alter future land use designations.

Commissioner Wasniewski supported approval, saying his children had traversed the area safely in the past.

The Commission found that conditional use standards 1, 2, 4, and 8 were met based on:
- Additional information in supplemental materials
- Safety and ease of pedestrian access, including paths and crosswalks
- Available access to parks and amenities
- Plans for improvements at Britta Park
- Potential long-term transitions of large-format retail areas

#### University Bay Drive Projects

##### Lakeshore Nature Preserve Visitor Center

[Legistar 87841](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7268816&GUID=6CA4779B-C71D-4E51-9346-F3A9C80E0778), [Legistar 87657](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7268816&GUID=6CA4779B-C71D-4E51-9346-F3A9C80E0778), & [Legistar 88477](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7268816&GUID=6CA4779B-C71D-4E51-9346-F3A9C80E0778)

The Commission recommended approval of rezoning property at 1970-1978 University Bay Drive from CN (Conservancy) to PR (Parks and Recreation) District and conditional uses for an 11,500 square-foot visitor center for the Lakeshore Nature Preserve on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus. The project also included street vacation and realignment to accommodate the development.

Commissioner Mendez recused himself from these items due to his employment with UW-Madison and direct involvement in the proposal.

#### East Washington Avenue Development

##### WMC Foundation Building Replacement

[Legistar 88203](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7371081&GUID=1CEBFF64-AB21-4E92-AEDF-91F41E67D5CB), [Legistar 88204](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7371081&GUID=1CEBFF64-AB21-4E92-AEDF-91F41E67D5CB), & [Legistar 88209](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7371081&GUID=1CEBFF64-AB21-4E92-AEDF-91F41E67D5CB)

![WMC Building Replacement](resources/PC_2025-06-23_10.jpg){#PC_2025-06-23_3}

The Commission approved demolition of an office building at 501 E Washington Avenue and conditional uses for a seven-story, 223-unit apartment building in Urban Design District 4. The project also included a certified survey map approval.

#### Tax Incremental Financing Districts

The Commission approved several TID amendments, including:

[Legistar 88728](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7433816&GUID=B2B3C40D-1401-4C74-BB93-2CEBFD089A50) - Tax Incremental District #55 (Voit Farm) for affordable housing development

Additional TID approvals:
- [Legistar 88724](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=88724) - TID #42 (Wingra) amendment
- [Legistar 88725](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=88725) - TID #45 (Capitol Square West) amendment  
- [Legistar 88726](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=88726) - TID #48 (Regent Street) amendment
- [Legistar 88727](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=88727) - TID #53 (East Wilson Street) amendment

#### Referred Items

Several items were re-referred to future meetings at applicant requests:

- [Legistar 88449](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=88449) & [Legistar 88206](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=88206) - Reiland Grove development with 264 single-family lots and multi-family residences (re-referred to July 7, 2025)
- [Legistar 88341](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=88341) - Private school conditional use at 1402 Pankratz Street (re-referred to future meeting)
- [Legistar 88336](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=88336) - 80-unit apartment building at 709 Northport Drive (re-referred to July 7, 2025)

#### Additional Approvals

[Legistar 88450](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=88450) - Rezoning 1138 Williamson Street from TR-V2 to TSS (Traditional Shopping Street)

The meeting highlighted ongoing tensions between housing advocacy and comprehensive planning, with the Verona Road decision demonstrating the Commission's willingness to prioritize housing development even when it conflicts with adopted land use plans. The discussion underscored the importance of comprehensive plan designations in determining development appropriateness and revealed strategies developers use to maximize housing density within existing zoning frameworks.

### June 9, 2025

[Official Minutes](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=M&ID=1235179&GUID=A87E133B-6897-4364-96F6-69DB2F322DBD)

The Madison Plan Commission held a virtual meeting on June 9, 2025, approving several significant housing developments and multiple zoning code amendments to streamline development processes.

#### Zoning Code Amendments

##### Conditional Use Extensions Clarification

[Legistar 88003](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97340)

Staff presented proposed language changes to clarify that conditional uses for alterations are eligible for time extensions, not just the projects themselves. The goal was to make it clearer that Plan Commission approval is also extended when the City extends it, up to one year.

Linda Leferntz, the first registered speaker, agreed that extensions hadn't been an issue in the past but voiced concern that the proposed language could still be clearer and might be misused by staff and developers because it was "too broad." Commissioner Bhasin questioned what specific problem the language change was trying to address.

Zoning Administrator Katie Bannon explained that alterations do not need to come back to Plan Commission if they're minor, but the current language makes it seem as if the Commission cannot approve minor alterations if they are approved by the city. The modification clarifies that Plan Commission approval is also extended when the City extends it.

After clarification, the item passed unanimously.

##### Place of Worship Requirements

[Legistar 88006](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97343)

Although part of the zoning packet, Linda Leonards spoke in strong opposition to changes regarding place of worship capacity requirements. She claimed "600 is too many for capacity," mentioning that the same type of higher classification street requires conditional use. She argued the conditional use would no longer give preference to smaller, local streets. Despite her opposition, the Plan Commission passed the item unanimously.

##### Restaurant and Alcohol-Related Uses

[Legistar 88319](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97599)

Staff Bannon presented changes to streamline alcohol and entertainment licensing. Currently, Madison requires an additional entertainment license (beyond conditional use) if you have an alcohol license and want amplified sound indoors. The proposed changes aim to be quicker to obtain and more business-friendly while placing less administrative burden on the City.

Linda Leonards spoke passionately against the changes, referencing the Plan B controversy from the mid-2010s, where the Alcohol License Review Committee (ALRC) could not consider intended use with licenses like the Plan Commission can with conditional use applications. She argued that indoor amplified music can disturb neighborhoods, noting that Plan B could be heard in people's houses with vibrations felt throughout the neighborhood. She also mentioned "drunks stumbling through the neighborhood at 2am, making random porches their home for the night."

Commissioner Bhasin asked about different factors taken into account with licenses. Bannon gave an overview of ALRC powers, noting that ALRC can impose various conditions with entertainment licenses and that license revocation significantly impacts businesses.

Alder Figueroa Cole moved to eliminate the restaurant-nightclub wording because "they do not go hand-in-hand, the definitions are changing." The amended proposal passed unanimously.


#### University Avenue Mixed-Use Project

[Legistar 88325](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97605) & [87881](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97242)

The Commission approved a six-story mixed-use building at 3535-3553 University Avenue and 733-737 N Meadow Lane containing approximately 4,300 square feet of commercial space and 146 apartments. The project required rezoning from TR-C1 to CC-T and multiple conditional uses.

![University Ave. Side](resources/PC_2025-06-09_4.jpg){#PC_2025-06-09_4}

Staff Colin Punt noted the applicant had previously received approval for a five-story building but now wanted approval for six stories. Staff raised questions about approval standard regarding building height, as the permitted height is five stories and this would exceed permissions. The previous design exceeded almost 30 feet above the transition line, but the current design exceeds about 12 feet because of step-backs to houses to the north.

![Meadow Lane Side](resources/PC_2025-06-09_5.jpg){#PC_2025-06-09_5}

The developer team, including Randy Christianson from JLA Architects and Walter Briggs Development, had conducted neighborhood meetings. They requested conditional approval for setbacks at the back of the building rather than the front to maintain building quality, and asked for the sixth floor for community mixed-use. The project includes 7-foot sidewalks to aid bike and pedestrian traffic.

**Community Concerns:**
- Thomas Meloney opposed the project due to traffic concerns, noting 71 units were already being added before this project and calling additional units "horrendous." He suggested the Capitol Clinic and "Puff and Pass" store site should be used instead, with entrance and exit solely on University Avenue
- Michael Pomrany, representing the "overwhelming majority" in favor of development, appreciated the traffic calming deposit but wanted to know when it would be assessed and requested stronger traffic calming efforts
- Rick Kedzior, a neighbor with a fourth-grader, had safety concerns and recommended a four-times deposit increase and a 5-7 foot wide pedestrian island on Meadow Lane
- Jesse Dury worried about westbound University traffic needing to access the residential area

![Current Building](resources/PC_2025-06-09_7.jpg){#PC_2025-06-09_7}


**Project Details:**
- Studios rent for about $1,500/month (described as "market rate")
- Target residents are primarily professionals, UW Hospital employees, Epic employees, and occasional graduate students
- All units will have yearly leases
- Studios sell out fast, while two-bedroom units rent more slowly

A $10,000 deposit was required for traffic calming measures if the City needs to alter traffic flow due to development pressure. The City Engineer plans to conduct speed studies after development completion to determine appropriate traffic calming measures.

Both items passed unanimously, though Alder Field was excused for this vote.

#### Milwaukee Street Development

![First Voit Farm Development](resources/PC_2025-06-09_1.jpg){#PC_2025-06-09_1}

The Commission approved a four-story mixed-use building at 3450 Milwaukee Street containing approximately 6,200 square feet of commercial space and 156 apartments on Lot 4 and associated site improvements on Outlots 2 and 3 of the approved Starkweather plat (Voit Farm). The project passed unanimously.

#### Substance Abuse Treatment Facility

[Legistar IDs 88198](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97498) & [88199](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97499)

The Commission approved converting an assisted living facility at 842 Jupiter Drive into an approximately 54-bed residential substance abuse treatment facility with inpatient and outpatient counseling services.

Staff explained the facility would not have significant negative impact on the surrounding community, largely due to an experienced director being brought in from their Brookfield location and an approved security plan. Staff determined that ample street parking plus a small staff parking lot would be sufficient.

Ryan Schneider, the director from Brookfield, outlined the need for the facility, noting that one in five people develop a substance disorder in their lifetime and highlighting 380 addiction deaths in Dane County in 2023 alone. Key facility details:
- Exclusively treats voluntary clients
- No sex offenders or people charged with violent offenses would be admitted
- No EMS vehicles (unlike the current physical rehabilitation facility)
- Scheduled admission only, reducing ambulance traffic
- Treatment stays range from 30 to 45 days, with 45 days being most effective
- Since residents won't have cars, parking is only for outpatient treatment and staff
- Additional leased space in Madison provides more parking for outpatient care if needed

Both items passed unanimously.


#### Personal Storage Facility

[Legistar 88201](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97501) & [88207](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97507)

The Commission approved a personal indoor storage facility at 6901-6933 Manufacturers Drive. City staff noted that zoning requires the proposed building to be a minimum of two stories, but determined changes to the design could be altered to fit current zoning requirements.

![A 2-story self-storage?](resources/PC_2025-06-09_3.jpg){#PC_2025-06-09_3}

Staff cited concerns over future plans for the site regarding Dane County's future intersection redesign. The lots may be required to convert ingress and egress rights to the interstate when there is a design change by the Department of Transportation, though the City doesn't currently know when that may happen.

Weston Zuleger, speaking for the development team, said "We really don't have any issues at this point" with altering the design to meet zoning codes and potentially turning rights over to the DOT in the future.

Commissioner Bhasin asked about effective facility designs. Alder Guequierre questioned why the developer was looking at including a decorative tower to satisfy the two-story requirement rather than adding more usable space, referencing a 2018 rule aimed at pushing for denser development.

Staff Bannon clarified there are no specific language markers defining what constitutes a second story or required footprint, contrasting this with stricter zoning rules being imposed on 7 Brew Coffee planned for construction at the edge of the east side HyVee parking lot on East Washington Avenue.

Despite some deliberation, both items passed unanimously.

#### Additional Approvals

Several other items were approved on consent or with minimal discussion:

[Legistar 88329](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97609) - Street right-of-way vacation on Schewe Road

[Legistar 88195](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97495) - Conditional use for restaurant-tavern and food sales at 10 S Paterson Street

[Legistar 88202](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97502) - Demolition permit for single-family residence at 6105 S Highlands Avenue

**Additional Zoning Amendments:**
- [Legistar 88001](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97338) - SR-C3 District dimensional requirements
- [Legistar 88004](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97341) - Lakefront development setback requirements  
- [Legistar 88005](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97342) - Lodge, Private Club, Reception Hall uses in Suburban Employment Districts

#### Referred Items

[Legistar 87879](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97240) - A five-story mixed-use building at 4506-4514 Verona Road with 324 square feet of commercial space and 93 apartments was re-referred to the June 23, 2025 meeting at the applicant's request.

The meeting demonstrates continued strong development activity in Madison, with the Commission balancing community concerns about traffic and neighborhood impacts against the city's housing needs and development goals.

[Official Minutes](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=M&ID=1243598&GUID=C36CE722-831B-4CDE-AC96-7780ECA17484)

The Madison Plan Commission held a special in-person meeting on June 2, 2025, focusing on legal education for commissioners and updates on two major area planning processes.

#### Land Use Law Education Session

**Legistar ID:** [88387](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=14239927&GUID=BCA5CE67-4181-49EE-AD06-4762C3EDC95E)

Assistant City Attorney Kate Smith provided commissioners with an overview of Wisconsin land use law and the Plan Commission's role within that framework. The presentation highlighted the hierarchical nature of municipal land use authority.

![Creatures of the State](resources/PC_2025-06-02_1.jpg){#PC_2025-06-02_1}

According to meeting commentary, land use regulation in the United States is largely governed by state law, with Wisconsin granting cities significant authority to regulate zoning and set development conditions, but less latitude in determining whether individual developments meet those conditions.

![Land Use](resources/PC_2025-06-02_2.jpg){#PC_2025-06-02_2}


The discussion outlined three levels of municipal authority, from most to least discretionary:

- **Comprehensive Plans**: Cities have the most latitude when designing comprehensive plans, which describe the types of development and zoning changes the city will accept
- **Zoning Changes**: Less latitude is available for zoning changes that are consistent with the comprehensive plan
- **Conditional Use Permits**: The least discretion is available for conditional use permits


![Levels of Authority](resources/PC_2025-06-02_4.jpg){#PC_2025-06-02_4}


##### Conditional Use Permit Framework

The session explained that conditional use permits exist because some uses, such as large apartment buildings, are considered generally acceptable in various zones but only if certain conditions are met through a review process. However, there remains an expectation that cities will approve applications when conditions are met.


A key legal principle was illustrated through a recent court case: if a city denies a conditional use permit when the applicant has met all conditions and the city lacks reasons consistent with existing land-use ordinances, the applicant can successfully appeal to court. For example, a carwash development in a Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) on East Washington Avenue was initially denied its conditional use permit partly due to traffic concerns, but the developers won in court because no objective traffic study had been conducted to demonstrate increased traffic impacts.


![Conditional Use Permits](resources/PC_2025-06-02_5.jpg){#PC_2025-06-02_5}






The legal framework incentivizes cities to clearly articulate their land use goals in comprehensive plans and zoning ordinances, which increases predictability for developers and property owners. Changes to comprehensive plans, in particular, can grant developers additional rights, such as the ability to build more housing.

#### Southwest and Southeast Area Plan Updates

**Southwest Area Plan Legistar ID:** [88388](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7300954&GUID=D9ACDD71-BFE5-4E53-9A96-B50001999ECE)
**Southeast Area Plan Legistar ID:** [88389](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7300954&GUID=D9ACDD71-BFE5-4E53-9A96-B50001999ECE)


Planning Division staff provided updates on both area planning processes for the Southeast and Southwest parts of the city, which are currently in the community engagement phase. The timeline calls for first draft plans to be developed in Fall 2025 with approvals targeted for Spring 2026.


![Southwest Area Plan](resources/PC_2025-06-02_6.jpg){#PC_2025-06-02_6}

![Southeast Area Plan](resources/PC_2025-06-02_7.jpg){#PC_2025-06-02_7}


##### Community Feedback

Staff reported receiving diverse feedback from residents, with significant concerns raised about housing, transportation, and jobs throughout both planning areas.


![Public Engagement](resources/PC_2025-06-02_8.jpg){#PC_2025-06-02_8}
![Southwest Concerns](resources/PC_2025-06-02_9.jpg){#PC_2025-06-02_9}
![Southwest Concerns](resources/PC_2025-06-02_10.jpg){#PC_2025-06-02_10}


##### Southeast Area Focus

According to meeting commentary, some of the most significant changes to land use and transportation patterns could occur in the southeast area. The city plans to address several key issues:

![Southeast Concerns](resources/PC_2025-06-02_11.jpg){#PC_2025-06-02_11}


- Correcting inappropriate land-use recommendations along the Highway 151 corridor
- Improving connectivity across the highway
- Recommending sidewalks for any road reconstruction projects


![Southeast Concerns](resources/PC_2025-06-02_12.jpg){#PC_2025-06-02_12}



Staff noted that sidewalk recommendations, despite residents no longer being required to pay for them, are likely to be the most controversial element of any area plan.

#### Additional Business

The meeting also included member announcements about upcoming events:

- Alder Guequierre provided an update on the May 29, 2025 Smart Growth Madison housing summit titled "Building Blocks: The Housing Development Process and Financing"
- Darrin Wasniewski announced a June 4, 2025 AARP Wisconsin discussion on universal design in housing for aging in place
- Alder Glenn highlighted "Wear Orange Day" events scheduled for June 6-8 to promote gun safety awareness

[Official Minutes](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=M&ID=1235177&GUID=5B3C0A05-B4A1-4335-A598-0EE08C2B99C5)


The Madison Plan Commission met virtually on May 12, 2025, to consider several development projects and policy updates, including revisions to the city's code of conduct for elected and appointed officials.

#### Code of Conduct Updates

**Legistar ID:** [87483](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7250376&GUID=DE973233-9BDA-4584-8C19-041B3730B8E8)

The commission reviewed additions to the city code of conduct that would include provisions for the treatment of staff and members of the public. According to social media commentary on the meeting, the updates were characterized as covering obvious standards of behavior, and notably do not extend to social media conduct.

![Code of Conduct Changes](resources/PC_2025-05-12_1.jpg){#PC_2025-05-12_1}

#### Bear Claw Way Apartment Development

**Legistar ID:** [87658](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7269029&GUID=23813EAB-66C8-4402-A48C-082437419EFB)

The commission unanimously approved a conditional use for a 21-unit apartment building at 305 Bear Claw Way/9453 Spirit Street in a new west side subdivision. The project consists of approximately 80% two-bedroom units with the remainder being one-bedroom apartments.

![Streetside](resources/PC_2025-05-12_5.jpg){#PC_2025-05-12_5}


A key discussion point centered on parking requirements. The developers requested 30 parking stalls, with most housed in single-stall garages. The Urban Design Commission (UDC) had recommended eliminating 4 parking stalls to extend green space, but Alder Guequierre moved to approve the building with the full 30 stalls as requested by the developers, ignoring the UDC recommendation.

![Parking](resources/PC_2025-05-12_6.jpg){#PC_2025-05-12_6}


Alder Field noted during discussion that the location is approximately 1.5 miles from transit. The area will also have street parking available in addition to possible driveway parking in front of garage doors. Observers noted this represents a relatively low unit-to-parking ratio for the area.

#### Nakoma Road Rezoning Eliminates Restrictive Planned Development

**Legistar ID:** [87842](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7300954&GUID=D9ACDD71-BFE5-4E53-9A96-B50001999ECE)

The commission unanimously recommended approval of a rezoning at 3821 Nakoma Road from PD (Planned Development) to LMX (Limited Mixed Use). The case highlighted issues with Madison's older, overly prescriptive zoning practices.

![](resources/PC_2025-05-12_9.jpg){#PC_2025-05-12_9}

The property owner, who operates first-floor commercial space with second-floor residential, explained that the current PD zoning contains unusual restrictions requiring him to rent "to a family with not more than 2 children" or "single people working." Staff noted that the two-story mixed-use building next to residential was exactly what the LMX district was designed for.

Alder Field expressed satisfaction with eliminating another instance of PD zoning, stating that PD requirements are often hard to find and are less transparent than newer standardized zoning districts. PD zones, which are custom to each property, were very common in the past to customize zoning for individual developments.

#### Other Business

The commission also approved on the consent agenda an 11,000 square foot visitor center at the base of Picnic Point, though this item was later referred to a future meeting date.

The Plan Commission met Monday, April 28th to review several items; however, a considerable amount of the agenda was moved either to the consent agenda or moved to later meetings. Here's the breakdown:

#### Minocqua Brewing Company

[Legistar 87634](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97031) 

The most heated item on tonight's agenda was in regard to the **consideration of conditional use** for Minocqua Brewing Company, located at **2927 E Washington Avenue** in **District 15.** The request specifically asks for **amplified sound** on an outdoor eating patio for a tasting room in a **Commercial Corridor-Transitional District (CC-T) District.**

Staff Chris Wells presented, reminding the Commission of the 2024 approval for the biergarten to have amplified sound until 9pm. According to the application, owner Kirk Bangstad does not anticipate having music going the entire window—only planning to have music and sound playing until 8:45pm; however, this contradicts the establishment's prior behavior. According to Staff Wells, Minocqua Brewing was notified of a violation in October 2024 after reports of amplified sound coming from the biergarten after 9pm. Commissioner Heck later inquired into this notice, with City Inspector Matt Tucker offering some clarity into the complaint and the investigative process. Tucker, who was personally involved in the case, stated the City first receives a complaint. At that point, their office issues a notice while they look into the issue. If the notice resolves the issue, no further action is taken; however, if the behavior is not corrected, the establishment is issued a municipal citation and the case runs the potential to get referred daily to the City Attorney's Office for legal action.

In this specific case, the City found an event had taken place in the backyard area after their 9pm cutoff. Additionally, the Inspector's Office discovered a website with a list of upcoming music events in the patio area—several of which were stated to go past the 9pm cut-off. Tucker said Bangstad was sent a reminder about outdoor music being prohibited and that it was too late in the evening for these events. According to Tucker, Minocqua Brewing was not cited as the behavior was corrected.

Along with noting the notice, Staff Wells drew attention to only eight of the previous 78 applications similar to Minocqua's having been approved. Of those eight, the median distance to the nearest residence was 138 feet, compared to 40 feet in this case. While Bangstad's application does include sound dampening measures, Staff still raised concern over previous violations with sound amplification. Ultimately, the Staff Report recommended placing the application on file without prejudice.

Bangstad was the first to speak during the public hearing, kicking things off with a passionate and well-rehearsed speech. The Minocqua Brewing Company Owner reminisced over a Parisian cafe once frequented by late American icons, expressing his desire to create the same atmosphere right here in Wisconsin. Then, the reign of Donald Trump and the COVID-19 Pandemic threatened his business—ultimately forcing him out of his original Minocqua location. Bangstad placed a great deal of blame on "Trumpers" and politics. Despite shared liberal views, Bangstad went on to state "Madison is a sanctuary from the worst Wisconsin has become... unfortunately politics got in the way again [of his idea Biergarten Cafe]."

Alex Sherwood, who lives on the neighboring property, provided testimony in stark contrast to Bangstad's. Sherwood argued wherever sound is amplified there is "stress and conflict," but stated "this is different." Any time the patio is open, Sherwood and their partner can hear conversations from inside their home—calling the location an "acoustic marvel" with how effortlessly the concrete design causes sound to bounce around and amplify. While Sherwood and their spouse are musicians, and love their neighborhood because of its focus on the arts, the sound has become a major source of stress. They would rather be in their yard writing about joy, instead they are stuck documenting sound disturbances. As part of their final statement, Sherwood referenced the potential one-year trial period in the proposal before tonight's commission members, but reminded them of the previous year's misconduct. According to the neighbor, Minocqua Brewing has basically already had a year trial period full of disturbances and violations. Another year would simply lead to additional agitation and stress.

Nick Pjevak, who previously served as Chair for the City of Madison's Arts Commission, acknowledged both sides of the evening's debate. While he urged the City to be more supportive of the arts, he agreed with Staff and Sherwood that the condensed nature of our city has its drawbacks. Drawing on two examples, Pjevak praised the Harmony Bar for their ability to meet zoning requirements while also maintaining a conscious effort towards being good stewards of sound in their neighborhood.

Alder Field began by asking about the October violation and what steps had been taken to ensure it did not happen again. Bangstad claimed to be unaware, saying he did not know anything about activities going later than 9pm. Rather than answering the second half of Alder Field's question, Bangstad took the opportunity to take a jab at their neighbor, claiming Sherwood is simply building a record to hurt their Biergarten, to which he quickly realized his misstep and added an acknowledgment of their relationship not being great, but "it is what it is." Meanwhile, Alder Guequerre was more interested to hear what other neighbors had to say about the situation and called on the representative present from the Shenk-Atwood neighborhood. Doug Johnson responded, noting the email they sent in mostly echoes Staff's comments about not meeting condition three of the zoning appropriateness. Johnson drew further attention to the proposal's only inclusion of noise dampening being putting blankets on the fence. According to Johnson, this would not help with sound going up to neighbors' second floors or deter noise from bouncing up into bedrooms. Newly elected Alder Carmela Glenn (District 18) also noted this later, asking for Bangstad to be more specific with how the sound dampening would work. The owner stated that the Minocqua Brewing Company would allow the sound to bounce off patrons, then onto the barriers included in the proposal, before dissipating. Alder Glenn did not follow up, but did not seem impressed with the answer as it did not address the issue of sound reaching the second floor.

Newly elected Alder Pritchett took a much gentler approach when conversing with Bangstad, despite her authoritative undertone. While she urged the owner to engage with neighbors more to offer clarity and foster better relations, Alder Pritchett reminded Bangstad that "after all, the neighborhood was there before you came... you're going to have to do some work. And that means engaging them. That will buy you a whole lot of currency." Alder Pritchett then asked what attempts would be made moving forward to connect with the residents and Bangstad once again became flustered. He immediately referenced the 120 decibels from the F35s quaking the buildings every day to compare to the amplified sound he proposes—"maybe every now and then you hear some opera, or some jazz, or some Celtic music" before making another direct dig at his neighbors, saying "maybe that isn't enough for some people [to have music instead of jets]."

Ultimately, the Plan Commission voted to place the Minocqua Brewing Company's application on file without prejudice.

#### Brennan's Market

[Legistar 87636](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7266227&GUID=31A6A2D6-59BE-4408-BD18-DBDA941FBA5E)


The final item of the night was a similar application for Brennan's Market, located at **8216 Watts Road** in **District 1.** Specifically, the consideration of an **alteration to an approved Planned Development District-Specific Implementation Plan (PD-SIP) to amend the zoning text to remove the prohibition of outdoor amplified sound and add conditional uses,** as well as the consideration of a **conditional use in the Planned Development (PD) District for a restaurant-nightclub** and consideration of a **conditional use in the PD District for amplified sound in an outdoor eating area,** all to allow a winery to be converted into a restaurant-nightclub with amplified sound in an existing outdoor eating area. Simply put, Brennan's wants to expand the existing eating area tied to their deli and wine market to include a more welcoming environment—which includes outdoor music.

Staff Wells once again presented, reminding the Commission of a previous zoning amendment that allowed amplified sound from 11am to 11pm and outdoor seating for up to 25 people. In this case, the applicant wants to change the conditional use to include a restaurant-nightclub to accommodate alcohol sales. While Brennan's is a wine vendor, they currently do not sell wine by the glass. The applicant would also like to host live music events outside seasonally, roughly one to two times per week anywhere from 9am to 9pm, which would be well within the previous amendment's allowance. Wells specified that the nearest residence is 160 feet from the patio—landing above the median for previously approved applications. This is in addition to the parking area between the residence and Brennan's, as well as a cross street (Commerce Drive). Overall, staff were optimistic and believed the standards to be met, pending a six month trial period.

Despite Staff's positive recommendation, the neighboring All Saints Neighborhood, a 55+ community located across Watts Road, submitted their opposition. Included with concerns by residents were those of doctors and treating specialists involved with the care of a number of the All Saints residents. Commissioner Heck specifically asked Brennan's owner, Tim Mulcahy, if the applicant would have any issue not playing music until after 3pm, Monday through Friday. Mulcahy said there would be no issue—emphasizing they do not want to have early music, how their neighbors are their patrons, and that they just want to "add dimension" to their surrounding community. The applicant went on to clarify they only envision utilizing the conditions Thursdays through Sundays after 5pm to draw people in; furthermore, they want to make sure all parties are happy in this whole scenario. Mulcahy reassured the Commission "our business is not hanging in the balance by this approval or denial, just adding a layer of ambiance and excitement to the venue."

Alder Pritchett joined the conversation, giving some constructive criticism on how to better connect with neighbors and assuage the concerns of the All Saints Neighborhood. Most notably, Alder Pritchett encouraged Mulcahy to include music that would appeal to their elderly neighbors—something they could sit on their patios and listen to. Mulcahy excitedly told Alder Pritchett, "you are definitely hired as my event coordinator for sure!" This was followed by praise from Alder Harrington-McKinny, who commended Mulcahy for "wanting to be a good neighbor" to a group that is often excluded.

As a group, many acknowledged previous complaints made against Cider Farm, who attempted a similar venture prior to the Brennan's application. Alder Duncan specifically asked about issues with the former leases, to which Mulcahy responded they were not sure who made the complaints; however, they would be interested in finding out so as to ensure their comfort and prevent them from being disturbed unreasonably in any way. Alder Guequerre followed up for clarification regarding the intended hours of live music, asking if changing the language to disallow amplified music Monday through Friday would have a significant impact on the applicant. Mulcahy said although they had hoped to include Thursdays for music, limiting to weekends only was an amenable compromise.

In the end, Alder Guequerre moved to approve the application with specific conditions provided by Staff, limiting music to Saturdays and Sundays only from 5pm to 9pm. The motion was seconded by Alder Glenn and passed.

Tuesday night Madison was treated to another short and sweet Plan Commission meeting, with the ten items being passed with the evening’s consent agenda and three items making it to the floor—two of which were bundled together.

#### Consent agenda items included:

#### Electric Generator for Green Tree Landfill

Item 11 of the night focused on [Legistar 87469](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7249848&GUID=7B2932B3-5397-4B49-87A1-16416F7BA8F2): **Conditional use** in the **Conservancy (CN) District** to allow for the installation and use of an emergency electric generator at the Greentree Landfill, located at **6802 Hammersley Road** in **District 20.**  Staff reviewed the proposal, noting the site is currently supported by one gas generator. The new electric generator is set to be installed on a pad directly next to the current unit, which sits 140 feet from the nearest residence. The emergency generator pad would be roughly five feet closer and is expected to run 20 hours a year total. The run time estimate is based on one hour a month for maintenance on the gas generator (twelve hours total) and power outages that would stop the existing unit’s pump and halt operation (expected eight hours a year, but would be weather dependent).

Jay McLellan, a district resident, voiced concern over the need for the generator and their confusion surrounding communications sent out by City Engineering. McLellan stated they received a postcard last week with notice of tonight’s meeting, but no information on why an additional generator was slated to be installed at the landfill. This was concerning, as the location has a history of danger, with McLellan referencing the explosion of a home on Hammersley Road in the 1980’s as a result of gasses escaping the landfill. They had no issues with views or noise that would be caused by the new unit, but rather safety and how the need was assessed.

Jack Brody, present to answer questions on behalf of the City’s Engineering division, was unable to answer Alder Harrington-McKinny’s follow-up inquiry on improving communications with residents; however, Brody gave further insight to the need for the generator. Going off of Alder Guequierre’s questioning of current City protocol, Brody confirmed the City dispatches mobile generators when needed. This can be problematic, as there are only two units available, which other entities such as the Madison Fire Department often request to use. Shared use is in addition to generators needing to be transported by staff, which can be difficult during flooding and winter storms. Brody acknowledged the safety concerns, and highlighted the Greentree Landfill as having the highest potential for explosion—furthering the need for the electric back-up. Currently, the City will not allow the generator to be down more than four hours at a time due to gas build-up and potential leaks. In the event of an outage, the landfill can be allowed to sit without a running generator for up to 24 hours before becoming a major safety concern, although letting it sit that long is not ideal. Brody clarified the generator would come out of Engineering’s budget, not the City’s.

The item **passed** with unanimous approval from the plan commission.

#### Park-and-Ride Lot for the University of Wisconsin-Madison

[Legistar 87471](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7249866&GUID=C84FAF01-E6A2-4713-B787-08676CD4B989) and [87475](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7249935&GUID=6CE0EA40-F16E-4286-AAF8-B920C465261E)
 both concerned additional parking for UW—the former being for **conditional use in an Industrial-Limited (IL) District** and the later for **approving a certified survey map** of a property owned by Madison Square Storage, LLC. in order to make way for a parking lot located at **2230 Pennsylvania Avenue** in **District 12.**

Commissioner Mendez recused themselves from voting, as their employment with the University is ties directly to this project. Alder Field and Commissioner McCahill also disclosed their employment with UW-Madison, but stated it would not impact their votes.

Staff once again presented, going over the proposed use for the lot. UW offers [park and ride options for employees](https://transportation.wisc.edu/commuter-solutions/park-and-ride/) Monday through Friday, with charter buses running every 20 minutes during peak times and every 30 minutes during off-peak hours. The current plan would be to extend this option to the public on specific weekends for high-traffic events that expect to fill current parking allowances. The proposal includes 229 parking spaces, two motorcycle spots, and several bike slots for cyclists. Overall, Staff recommended approving the plan as they do not believe it will inhibit further development.

William Butcher, representing the developer working with the University to establish the park and ride, was questioned by the Commission on the plan’s inclusion of four electric vehicle spaces. Butcher acknowledged this is the minimum set forth by the City; however, they are currently reworking the plan to increase that number to 20–possibly 23. Butcher says they are more than amenable to exceeding the four spots, it is simply a matter of input and electrical planning. Butcher also took a moment to highlight how the proposal would help alleviate traffic congestion and automobile emissions, all while increasing parking availability downtown due to less use by employees and visitors to the University.

Discussion emerged surrounding how UW decided on the location in question, to which Butcher did not know the specifics. He was able to say he understood UW had done their due diligence, taking into consideration access to public transit, commute time from the lot to campus, and the location falling outside of the primary downtown areas with the highest need for additional housing. Aside from those items, he could not say why or how the University settled on this particular site. Butcher added that several neighborhood associations in the area had been contacted, as well as district Alder Latimer Burris, and based on responses their was no need to hold a public hearing regarding the proposed development.

Commissioner Heck specifically asked if this would be a free or paid parking option. Butcher, being with the developer and not UW Transportation, did not know. Commissioner Mendez did not contribute to the conversation or provide additional information regarding UW-Madison's planned use of the lot, despite being the [Director of Transportation Operations](https://transportation.wisc.edu/about/#leadership).

This author examined the issue and found there are no free parking options available to University employees. Other park and ride options are available [but require a permit](https://transportation.wisc.edu/rates-and-policies/rates/) can be seen on the UW Transportation website for anyone interested in a more comprehensive answer on expected fees associated with using the lot. Commissioner Heck further questioned why the model is not closer to what we have seen for EPIC employees, with further lots from EPIC’s campus and a central drop-off location. While Butcher is not aware of the logistics, Transportation’s website also shows multiple stops on campus which get employees closer to their office location.

Stemming from questioning from Commissioners McCahill and Heck, Butcher did disclose the University is placing pressure on the developer to have the project complete by the end of the Summer, likely for the start of the Fall semester and football season, and that the lease would be for 15 years. Commissioner Heck asked staff if they were allowed to limit the conditional use to five years and reassess at a later date based on housing needs, which staff responded yes. This prompted Commissioner Wasniewski to ask staff if this proposal fit into the City Plan. Staff drew attention to the location’s current zoning as being industrial and containing a generous amount of warehouses. As such, staff believe it conforms to the current City Plan.

While Commissioners Heck and McCahill did so begrudgingly—finding it difficult to approve a parking lot instead of housing—the items **both passed unanimously.**

#### Secretary’s Report

Secretary Tuttle corrected a statement from the March 17th, clarifying tonight’s meeting was the final for current sitting Alders, not March 17th. Although Wisconsin just held an election April 1st, which included the Alder race on Madison ballots, the newly elected alders have yet to be sworn in and assigned to their respective committees. Tuttle once again thanked everyone for their participation, preparation, and contributions as members of the Plan Commission.

Tuttle also drew attention to several development highlights from this past year, including the approval of just over three thousand multi family homes, 161 new single family homes, and 134 lots for two-family residences. This is in addition to approving over 700 preliminary lots for further housing developments. While this is a decline from previous years, it is similar to numbers seen in 2021 and the Plan Commission continues to see a promising, steady stream of applications to further housing, plats, and conditional use within the City of Madison.

[Official Minutes](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=M&ID=1235147&GUID=D5D7C999-88C7-4DD3-A3F5-D01B181D4DDA)


The March 17th, 2025 Plan Commission Meeting was short and sweet, with most of the items being passed or placed on file without prejudice as part of this week’s consent agenda. Although Alder Field, along with Commissioners McCahill and Mendez, disclosed their affiliation with the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Commissioner Mendez was the only member to abstain from voting on the 210 Bernard Court demolition, as Mendez has direct involvement with the project. Alder Field and Commissioner McCahill stated for the record they are not involved in the request and their employment status at the University would not impact their votes.

The consent agenda consisted of six items total, three of which were passed unanimously and three of which were placed on file without prejudice.

#### Items Passed Unanimously:
 - Consideration of a **demolition permit** to demolish a three-family residence at **210 Bernard Court** in District 8 [Legistar 87142](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7132213&GUID=2B6DEF88-0E50-4B80-A082-81097F6BB520&Options=ID|Text|&Search=87142).
 - Consideration of a **demolition permit** to demolish a financial institution located at **6702 Odana Road** in District 19 [Legistar 87140](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7131981&GUID=7A137A02-684F-41DE-A0DE-4E5E5FD4A6E3&Options=ID|Text|&Search=87140).
 - **Conditional use** at **6702 Odana Road** in District 19 in a Commercial Center (CC) District for dwelling units in a four-story mixed-use building with approximately 1,973 square feet of commercial space and 60 apartments [Legistar 87141](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7132008&GUID=21D483C9-D453-48DC-93E7-F3EB368E4768&Options=ID|Text|&Search=87141).

#### Items Placed on File without Prejudice:

 - [Placed on file due to being withdrawn:] consideration of **conditional use** in the Commercial Corridor-Transitional (CC-T) District to convert a restaurant-tavern to a restaurant-nightclub located at **1025 N Sherman Avenue** in District 12 [Legistar 87144](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7132352&GUID=84E49B93-59B2-4E09-B754-C106EB796649&Options=ID|Text|&Search=87144).
 - [Developer has withdrawn demolition application:] consideration of a **demolition permit** to demolish a mixed-use building, including an apartment and restaurant located at  **77 Sirloin Strip** in District 14 [Legistar 86732](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7090673&GUID=41EC58A4-DA53-489F-A046-F74231A87709&Options=ID|Text|&Search=86732).
 - [Proposed conditional use cannot proceed due to demolition application being withdrawn:] Consideration for **conditional use** in the [proposed] Traditional Residential-Urban 1 (TR-U1) District for a multi-family dwelling with greater than 60 units to allow for construction of a 74-unit apartment building located at **77 Sirloin Strip** in District 14 [Legistar 86733](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7090695&GUID=5C8228FD-4303-48D7-9B50-E10BF02A0A43&Options=ID|Text|&Search=86733).

#### Jay’s, 406 North Frances Street, Conditional Use

[Legistar 87143](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7132351&GUID=DC8B2828-BC5C-48FC-A9C7-3A813CE0FEFC&Options=ID|Text|&Search=87143)

The only item up for discussion was consideration for conditional use in an Urban Mixed-Use (UMX) District for a nightclub at Jay’s in District 2, located at 406 North Frances Street. Staff Chris Wells presented, reviewing the applicant’s request for approval to operate the proposed nightclub out of an existing tavern. The owner, Jay Wanserski, joined the public hearing via telephone to gain clarity on the closed doors condition and how that impacted the ability for their establishment to utilize garage doors that open sections of the building wall to allow for additional airflow in the warmer months. The public hearing initially closed following Wanserski’s speaking time allotment; however, Commissioner Heck asked staff if the Plan Commission had authority over conditions set in the approval. Staff confirmed the commission could alter conditions, citing the 2022 approval for Red Rock Saloon’s application with a condition allowing Red Rock to keep their similarly styled garage doors open until midnight. In order to gain a better understanding of the owner’s plans for operating the night club, a movement was made to reopen the public hearing.

Commissioner Heck led the discussion with Wanserski, clarifying that live music would end before midnight or the garage doors must be shut. It was agreed Jay’s may keep their garage doors open when music is coming from their jukebox, with Wanserski noting that most performers end their sets before midnight. Wanserski further noted any music played from the jukebox after midnight is typically quieter due to fewer patrons filtering in and out during the hours leading up to bar time. Ultimately, Commissioner Heck moved to amend the conditions to meet Wanserski’s request and the change passed. This was immediately followed by the Plan Commission’s approval of the application for conditional use.

#### Closing Remarks

Closing out the meeting, Secretary Tuttle mentioned a three week break in meetings and heavier agendas coming next month due to the April 1st election and Alder turnover. Along with providing updates regarding 77 Sirloin Strip from the Common Council Meeting, Secretary Tuttle also noted the Lamp House substitute was adopted by the Madison Alders. The Commission adjourned, with the next meeting scheduled for Monday, April 7th.

[Official Minutes](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=M&ID=1235146&GUID=17573E4C-D31A-4C88-A095-1426BAABB724)

The March 3, 2025 Plan Commission Meeting discussed the following actions:

1.  Recommended that Council deny a rezoning request for a 74 unit apartment development at 77 Sirloin Strip be denied.
2.  Recommend that Council amend the Lamp House Report to make it clear that did not adopt its recommended changes to height restrictions around the Lamp House.
3.  Approved conditional use for a drive-through coffee shop in a TOD overlay district at 3915 Lien Road.
4.  Approved demolition single-family homes and recommended rezoning around 922 Fair Oaks, 3222 East Washington for future multi-family.
5.  Recommended Council reject rezoning and preliminary plat for new Leo Living subdivision at 6303 Portage Road.

Before diving in to their key items, the Commission referred discussion of conditional use at 3915 Lien Road in District 3, in which a dive through window for a coffee shop is being requested ([Legistar 86523](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=96099)). Additionally, the Committee unanimously passed their consent agenda, which included:

#### Consent Agenda

-   Creating Chapter 21 of the Madison General Ordinances related to **Zoning Floodplain Regulations** and Maps ([Legistar 86804](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=96353))
-   Amending various sections within Chapter 28 of the Madison General Ordinances to remove **floodplain references** ([Legistar 86807](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=96356)) Creating Section 28.022-00703 of the Madison General Ordinances to change the zoning of property located at 321 Russell Street from PD (Planned Development) District to TSS (Traditional Shopping Street) District.

#### 77 Sirloin Strip Development

-   [Demoltion, Legistar 86732](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=96289)
-   [Conditional Use, Legistar 86733](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=96290)
-   [Zoning, Legistar 86990](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=96509)

A new development proposal has been submitted for 77 sirloin strip in district 14 on Madison’s south side. The application covers demolition (legislar 86732), rezoning from Traditional Residential- Varied 2 to Traditional Residential- Urban 1 (TR-V2 to TR-U1 under Legistar 86990), and consideration of conditional use in a TR-U1 zone for a multi-family dwelling to allow for a 74 unit, 55+ Senior Living apartment building (Legistar 86733).

City Staff Tim Parks presented, covering a plan proposed by Imminent Development Corp. and Sketchworks Architecture that would replace the existing building currently housing Pollo Rumbero and previously Hooka Lounge. Parks highlighted the proposal and the applicants’ desire to measure building height based on an exhausting rock shelf that covers the site, why the conditional use would be needed due to the number of planned units, and how the building height will need further conditional use allowances due to the current design coming to a total of six stories—two partially exposed levels below four stories of residences.

The owner of Pollo Rumbero, Araceli Rivera, spoke during the public meeting, voicing concerns over the termination of her current lease and having received no communication from the developer, only a notice from the current building owner. Rivera noted how not only would relocation cause hardship for their business, but would also impact their community outreach. Currently, Pollo Rumbero offers community space to the neighboring trailer park and overflow parking, in addition to opening their doors as a storm shelter when the weather makes the trailer park unsafe. Additionally, Rivera emphasized their initiatives in feeding the homeless and their educational outreach. Pollo Rumbero offers scholarships to students attending college and regularly donates to local high schools to help students in need.

Julian Walters, a representative from Imminent Development assured the Commission their company had done its due diligence by holding a community meeting to discuss concerns with local residents; however, only “about 3 to 5 people” attended. Although it is unclear if meeting announcements were also posted/provided in Spanish, Walter’s stated a translator was available had Rivera attended the meeting. Walters further claimed Imminent Development was willing to work with Sketchworks and Pollo Rumbero on potentially leasing out a portion of the new building to house the restaurant, as well as incorporate plans for shared community’s spaces and shelters that would be available to the neighboring mobile home residents.

The situation gave the Commission pause, as Commissioner Solheim draw attention to how the plans provided with the application do not include some of the spaces Walters mentioned, in addition to Staff’s concerns over the height of the building and construction in an area of Madison which is already getting a considerable facelift as part of the 2025 Comprehensive Plan. While Commissioner Heck was concerned over WHEDA’s cyclical funding, the Commission ultimately placed all three items on file as the plans seemed “half-baked.” The items will be revisited at the March 17th, 2025 meeting to allow Imminent Development and Sketchworks to create a more holistic plan before the Commission makes a decision.

#### Amending The Lamp House Report

[Legistar 86824](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=96373)

The commission moved on to discuss a potential Amendment to the Report of the Lamp House Block Ad Hoc Plan. Previously, the report cited concerns over further developing the Lamp House, as it is listed on the National Register for Historic Places due to having been designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The report called for the maintenance of several lines of sight both to the Lamp House from the street and from the Lamp House out to Lake Mendota. This is in conflict with the 6 story height limits in the surrounding areas. In 2021, Council considered whether to officially alter nearby height limits to match what was requested in the Lamp House report, but rejected the idea. Nonetheless, staff consider the Lamp House report to be a part of city plans, and so will not allow development that conflicts with it.

Alder Bennett proposed an amendment to the Lamp House report to eliminate recommendations to preserve views that limit development opportunities. This was met with criticism at Landmarks Commission, who in particular were concerned that editing the report itself disrespected the integrity of the original recommendations. Alder Field proposed a substitute ammendment that would place an adendem at the end of the Lamp House report stating that Council chose not to change height limits in response to the report. This is intended to end the conflict between city plans and the Lamp House report that has prevented development.

Bruce Bosben, who currently owns the Lamp House, has previously applied to further develop the building while preserving the design while adding residential space above the existing structure in order to meet the city’s current housing needs in the downtown area. Bosben has no desire to demolish the building, but notes that it is currently not sustainable as a stand-alone tourist attraction, even with its status as a Frank Lloyd Wright structure. As part of his venture, which began in 2014, Bosben has been in contact with the Frank Lloyd Wright Conservancy in Chicago. According to the Chicago office, there is no reason not to add residential space above the Lamp House, so long as the integrity and as much of the original architecture as possible is preserved.

While Bosben aims to maintain the property and keep it true to its original architecture, aside from the proposed additions, the Madison Historical Trust is highly against further development. Opponents such as Jack Holzhueter went as far as to request a vote be passed “to put \[the proposal\] on file with prejudice \[because\] this is a self-serving act on the part of individuals.” This led Alder Bennett to further inquire into Bosben’s conversations with the Frank Lloyd Wright Conservancy. Bosben reiterated the Conservancy feels they “must advocate for the protection of Wright resources;” however, they are in favor of the project because it would allow for redevelopment while placing Wright’s work as a key, functioning competent in the new structure. Bosben clarified the Lamp House is not falling apart, taking credit for being a “good custodian” despite how harsh student renters can be on this and similar properties he owns, and stated he did not want this to be a fight with the City, but would like to find some sort of middle ground in order to help address the housing crisis.

#### Lein Road Coffee Shop

[Legistar 86523](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=96099)

Further discussion occurred regarding the Consideration of a conditional use in the Commercial Corridor-Transitional (CC-T) District and Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Overlay District for a drive-through window to allow construction a coffee shop with drive-through window (legistar 86523). The proposed coffee shop, which would be located at 3915 Lien Road in District 3, aims to offer two drive through lanes, as well as a walk-up window option for pedestrians. City Staff believe the conditional use conditions have been met, as there is ample, safe space for pedestrian use and cyclists would be able to use the lanes just as a vehicle would. The only notable concerns brought to the commission were grading surrounding the build site, as the flat is lower than the neighboring streets of East Washington Avenue and Lein Road.

Subsequently, Alder Field requested more information regarding accessibility. Malena Olivera, a representative in attendance on behalf of the developers, Plaza Street Partners, provided clarification on how they are currently looking to how to add additional access points that will be both handi-capable and ADA compliant, depending on how many they can add and where they will be able to get approval for the access points’ locations while taking into consideration the grade and safety of existing retaining walls. Alder Field also inquired as to whether or not the Plan Commission could request additional signage requirements in order to make access points easier to locate and navigate. City Staff member Parks clarified they cannot control signage, but they could advise and/or advocate for additional postings. Field made a motion to request language on signage to be added, to which Commissioner Tuttle weighed in and the Plan Commission was agreeable with. Ultimately, the request was approved before moving on to the next topic of the evening.

The Commission quickly reviewed demolition and future use for two locations. The first parcel, located at 922-926 N Fair Oaks Avenue in District 12, included Legistars 86734 and 86991. Consideration calls for the demolition of two single-family homes and rezoning from a TR-C1 (Traditional Residential-Consistent 1) District to a CC-T (Commercial Corridor-Transitional) District. The second concerned 3222, 3230, and 3238 E Washington Avenue, also in District 12, regarding the consideration of a demolition permit to demolish three single-family residences.This is in conjunction with legistar 86992, which changes the zoning of property located at 3222-3238 East Washington Avenue and 3229 Ridgeway Avenue from a TR-C1 (Traditional Residential-Consistent 1) district and a TR-C4 (Traditional Residential-Consistent 4) district to TR-U2 (Traditional Residential-Urban 2) district. All four items passed, allowing for further development to take place within District 12. These changes make way for two future apartment developments.

#### LEO Living Subdivision Plat at 6303 Portage Road

-   [Preliminary Plat Legistar 86736](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=96293)

The final item of the night included legistars 86993 and 86736, which focus on development proposals at 6303 Portage Road and 4821 Hoepker Road in District 17. The first component was comprised of changing the zoning of the property located at 6303 Portage Road and 4821 Hoepker Road from a Temp. A (Temporary Agricultural) District to an A (Agricultural) District, as well as changing the zoning of the property located at 6303 Portage Road and 4821 Hoepker Road from a Temp. A (Temporary Agricultural) District to a TR-P (Traditional Residential-Planned) District. The second consisted of approving the preliminary plat of the LEO Living on property addressed as 6303 Portage Road and 4821 Hoepker Road.

Staff immediately proposed denying the requests, stating they do not believe the proposal fits their city plans for the site due topographical concerns within the 6303 parcel. Namely, the intermittent stream located on the property and floodplains and other topographical issues led city plans ([Pumpkin Hollow Neighborhood Plan](https://www.cityofmadison.com/dpced/planning/documents/Pumpkin_Hollow_NDP.pdf) and [Rattman Neighborhood Plan](https://www.cityofmadison.com/dpced/planning/documents/Rattman_NDP_update_070219.pdf)) to not call for housing on the developed portion of the land. Due to this, Staff referenced the likelihood of future structural issues due to erosion, even with the plan’s inclusion of retaining walls.

Joann Rubio, a member of the development team proposing future housing on the parcels, stated they believe their team would be meeting the Pumpkin Hollow development objectives by constructing a mixed-use building which would be available to families, seniors, and community resources. Rubio further argued the Department of Natural Resources does not include the intermittent stream in their 1988 assessment as an environmental corridor—noting the DNR has not issue with the proposed building plans so long as the developer recognizes and utilized the natural drain-off. Rubio also mentioned retaining walls were only included in the proposal due to the developer’s haste in getting their paperwork submitted to the City, but that they were open to modifications and suggestions on how to best address both the flood plains and grading of the parcels. Commissioner Solheim asked Staff Tim Parks to review the DNR’s assessment, to which Parks responded, noting the City is aware of the stream’s impact on the parcel. Parks emphasized its importance, noting is is protected by both “law and environmental ethos,” and clarifying its not being included in the DNR’s assessment does not negate its importance to local waterways. According to City records and the Staff report, the intermittent stream begins on the property before joining other tributaries that ultimately flow into Starkwater Creek.

Solheim moved to put the rezoning request on file without prejudice due to inconsistencies with Rattman’s and Pumpkin Hollow’s development objectives, as well as zoning incompatibility/failure to meet future use requirements and was passed by the Plan Commission. Solheim then moved to deny the approval of the preliminary plat due to concerns over stormwater and street recommendations. The Commission agreed and legistar 86736 was denied before the meeting adjourned.

#### 2025 Progress Update - City of Madison Comprehensive Plan

[Legistar 86656](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7087167&GUID=8B73FA8B-FFB6-47BF-92E1-D16B905C58DD)

City Staff members Brian Grady and Breana Collins reviewed the new comprehensive plan, spotlighting some of the City’s most ambitious goals and important objectives. Grady emphasized how the plan is used to help guide the City’s budget and planning requests, adding the plan is also important for private sector planning regarding framework, growth, and future land use.

This year’s plan is made up of 7 elements, which include 14 goals, 59 strategies, and 209 actions for implementation. After receiving feedback from roughly 15,000 community members, affordable housing and Madison’s very own BRT have once again been noted as the city’s hottest topics.

The plan includes its own Neighborhood and Housing element, which Collin’s drew much attention to. Noteworthy items included the rehabilitation of the Tree Lane public housing units, the addition of 639 housing units throughout Madison, and redevelopment at the Triangle—primarily, the replacement of old public housing with mixed income apartments and complexes such as Bayview, revamping their properties to include more colorful and vibrant housing.  Secretary Tuttle later commented on the City’s approval of over 5,600 permits for new homes between 2023 and 2024–commending the Plan Commission for its involvement in the approval of many of those requests and aiding in the City’s housing development efforts.

![Planning Process](resources/Plan_Structure_2025-02-03.jpg){#planning_process}

Madison Metro’s BRT is once again on everyone’s mind, as the City strives to keep improving the newly introduced system. Collins focused on the Comprehensive Plan’s use of federal funds to aid in the procurement of larger buses and the City’s implementation of a new fare system, citing the BRT as being the backbone of Madison’s public transportation due to its "Point A to Point B design." Towards the end of the meeting, Commissioner Heck requested additional details regarding Strategy 7.D, ("Develop and implement a park-and-ride plan to increase accessibility to downtown and the
UW–Madison campus."). City staff responded by noting how other communities with public transportation tend to have more park and ride options with larger lots in addition to greater access with less restrictive routes. If the City is able to implement the plan successfully, public transportation will be available to a larger part of the Madison Metropolitan population, effectively decreasing automobile traffic and congestion in the downtown area while creating safer spaces for pedestrians and cyclists.

Madison’s public spaces also gained an honorable mention at Tuesday’s meeting. The Commission drew further attention to accessible playgrounds being installed at both Rennebohm and Elver Park on Madison’s east and west sides, respectively, both of which boast inclusive features such as braille on their equipment. There was also discussion surrounding the intention to redesign a stretch of John Nolen Drive’s lakefront with the upcoming Lake Monona Waterfront Master Plan. Changes are expected to take decades; however, the city aims to have more usable public space in addition to its mission to expand safe cyclist and pedestrian routes while improving driveability. This led into a later discussion on State Street’s current battle between bikers and pedestrians now that it is a designated pedestrian area with limited auto access. Secretary Tuttle admitted prior to the Comprehensive Plan the city should have done more testing to better understand the transition, an error which has ultimately caused people to disregard cyclists and call into question who has the right-of-way when using the pedestrian zone.

Heck also the City of Madison plans to address the new Comprehensive Plan planning process in 2028, inquiring as to whether the plan will be based off of the 2025 proposal or if the City will start from scratch. Staff responded this will likely be dependent on several factors and the efficacy of their 2025 Comprehensive plan, which they expect to begin evaluating some time in late 2025 or 2026

Commissioner Solheim requested clarification on how the City anticipates advertising the 2025 Comprehensive Plan update and getting the word out. Grady mentioned the availability of Plan materials in several languages, including Spanish and Hmong, as well as an upcoming press release to gain more media coverage. Secretary Tuttle also encouraged Madisonians to spread awareness, either by word of mouth or by sending information to businesses, boards, and community members who may find it of interest.

Tuesday night’s Plan Commission Committee Meeting ran almost two and a half hours—primarily focusing on two key items:

1.  Conditional use for the Essen Haus to expand its hours of outside operation.
2.  The proposed demolition of two homes in the Wingra Neighborhood, with plans to build one single-family residence in their place.

Before diving into the issues, the committee voted to unanimously pass consent items such as:

#### Consent Agenda

-   Recommended to Council **Rezoning** at **709 Northport Drive** in District 18 from SR-01 to TR-U1 ([Legistar 83924](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7040532&GUID=AF384506-98B5-4DF3-B123-5A9BF2570F10&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=83924)).
-   **Conditional use** at **908 E. Main Street** in District 6 for a beauty school in a multi-use complex ([Legistar 86416](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7045337&GUID=ECC2B330-EA80-4550-8A81-E2F2913A3AAE&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=86416)).
-   Permit an **accessory building** on a lake-front property at **913 Woodward Drive** in District 18 ([Legistar 86418](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7045485&GUID=B796A950-A446-4EDB-B061-8ECD7554E0E2&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=86418)).
-   Permission to **eliminate a facade (demolition)** on a street-facing, single-family residence located at **2449 Fox Avenue** in District 13 ([Legistar 86420](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7045487&GUID=0F94D0BC-EE2C-446F-B04F-CA9BF3DEC8C9&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=86420)).
-   Recommend to Council to approve **certified survery map** for a residential lot at **4952 Thorston Road** in Sun Prairie in order to begin plans for two multi-family complexes ([Legistar 86421](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7045510&GUID=AB0B1694-77D0-4912-9579-482E42FD0BA5&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=86421)).

#### Essen Haus, 506-518 E Wilson Street, Conditional Use

[Legistar 86417](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7045484&GUID=31CD8EDB-C310-4A5B-A556-5975E1EABE2B)

Prior to re-zoning from PD to UMX, Essen Haus operated later into the evening and ran their Volleyball league two hours past the allowed hours stipulated by their approvals. Last year Plan Commission gave them conditional use approval for these outside events, but for an earlier end time, including for Volleyball. This application includes requests for live music events, later volleyball league end times, use of an outdoor eating patio, and later closing time requirements. Essen Haus and Come Back In owner, Robert Worm, spoke to the committee regarding the benefits of expanding events and hours at Essen Haus, arguing later hours made for a more active neighborhood. In his argument, which was echoed by some other members or the public, Worm referenced a decline in undesirable behavior. The previous red-light take-over of the area in the ‘70s and ‘80s declined, and “vice type" behavior prevalent in the ‘90s faded out as the Essen Haus and Come Back In supported a more active nightlife in the area; however, neighbors in the area were not enthusiastic about the proposed changes to the agreement. Bob J. and Stephen O’Neal, two nearby residents, argued against Worm’s appeal, both citing the noise as a primary reason for their concerns. While O’Neal made it clear he is not opposed to the activities themselves, the concern lies in disturbing what has become a dense residential neighborhood. Worm blames the disagreement on the change in management and residents in the condo he built in 1985 and later sold. Plan Commission ultimately allowed conditional use for later Volleyball hours in a unanimous vote; however, the approval was contingent on the operating under the similar conditions as the 2024 approval, meaning continuing to end serving at 9pm, limiting special live music events to two instead of three, and having doors to the patio area remain closed to prevent excess noise.

#### 1007 Edgewood Ave., Demolition

[Legistar 86419](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7045486&GUID=1C0AA69E-C841-4C0A-B93D-9D0E688CC257&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=86419)

The Committee also addressed reapplication to demolish two adjacent single-family homes on a single lot in the Wingra neighborhood. While the intended use for the lot is to create one, single-family residence, City Staff member Megan Tuttle noted that the intended use could not be considered as part of the proposal. John Collins, who holds the homes under Edgewood Park LLC., was represented at the meeting by Chris Nelson and Robert Procter. Nelson and Proctor argued the home should not be considered historical due to ‘unsympathetic alterations,’ which include the addition of vinyl siding on both homes and vinyl windows at 1007 Edgewood Ave. Several residents, some of which have experience rehabbing historical homes or with their certification, raised the question of the original wood siding being hidden underneath the vinyl. Bonnie Gruber, who shared a similar argument as other speakers in opposition of the demolition, stated a single residence replacing the two goes against Madison’s housing initiatives. Further stating each property should remain “a simple home for ordinary people and Madison cares about ordinary people.” Bob Klebba, expanded on Gruber’s statement, saying the reports submitted to the city supporting demolition read more like realtor’s evaluations—highlighting the applicants’ lack of official reports from the fire department, city, or similar certified entities. Ultimately, the demolition was denied by the committee for a second time, despite the attendance of attorneys representing John Collin’s and Edgewood Park, LLC.

#### 6201 Old Middleton Rd., Certified Survey Map

[Legistar 86415](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7045770&GUID=E7CBF326-10DD-41C0-8100-61BF440A7FFC)

After spending over an hour hearing speakers in support and opposition of the demolition application, the committee wrapped up their meeting with a brief review and vote towards approving an official survey map for a parcel located at 6201 Old Middleton Road on Madison’s west side. While questions were raised about the accuracy of an aerial survey that had been conducted, City staff Chris Wells confirmed the discrepancy, noting that aerial surveys are often only estimates whereas physical surveys yield actual square footage of the area in question. The intended use for the lot(s) in question would include one or multiple deep end residences. The movement for an official survey passed unanimously, and intended use will be determined at a later time, pending the survey’s findings.
