It was a short agenda this evening with the meeting taking less than 25 minutes.

- **Request for Certificate of Approval** of an addition to this Third Lake Ridge Historic District property located at **739 Jenifer St** in **District 6** [Legistar 88975](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7455490&GUID=FE72334F-3019-4D5D-A493-ACF1E691C024) was moved to the Consent Agenda. Motion to approve was made by Alderman Duncan and seconded by Jacob Morrison and passed unanimously.

#### Sauthoff House - 740 Jenifer St

**[Legistar 88974](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7455489&GUID=A5A5CB62-674F-47D8-A5B5-6665348204A4)** - **Request for Certificate of Approval of Demolition and Addition to a Designated Madison Landmark**

The home is in the Third Lake Ridge Historic District (District 6). The building, known as the Sauthoff House, was built in 1857 and was designated a Madison landmark in 1977. Frederick (a tailor) and Johanna Sauthoff moved from Hanover, Germany and were the first owners of the home. The Sauthoff House was designated a landmark for its association with 19th century merchant families in the early history of the city and for its vernacular architecture. In the 1950s a rear addition was added to the home. This addition, like other additions to historic homes in that period, has no significance in its own right.

![Historic photograph of the Sauthoff House at 740 Jenifer St, showing the original 1857 structure](resources\LM_2025-08-04_3.png)

The original building is characterized by its blocky style. The proposed addition on the back of the structure (which faces the lake) is a contemporary interpretation of this same blocky style. There will also be large open areas with many of the areas featuring large glass windows.

![Site plan and elevation drawings showing the integration of the new addition with the historic structure](resources\LM_2025-08-04_5.png)

Joy Newmann, the next-door neighbor, spoke very highly of the owner's care for the home and the proposed project. Leslie Marshall (homeowner), Michael Abraham and Abigal Rohlinger (Michael Abraham Architecture), and Mikael Eder (Bachman Construction) were available to answer questions. There were no questions.

Staff believes the standards for granting a Certificate of Approval could be met with several conditions. Jacob Morrison, Katherine Kaliszewski and Molly Harris made positive comments regarding the project and how well the contemporary addition blends with the original historic building.

Motion made by Molly Harris and seconded by Jacob Morrison to approve the project with recommended conditions. Motion passed unanimously.

#### Madison Trust for Historic Preservation Grant Program

**[Legistar 62943](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=73505)** - **Presentation on Grant Opportunities**

Jennifer Gurske, President of the Madison Trust for Historic Preservation, presented information about the organization's new grant program. The program was made possible through a generous donation from Erica Gehrig.

The Madison Trust will award a total of $10,000 annually in grants, with individual awards ranging from $5,000 to $10,000. The 2025 application period runs from August 1st through October 1st, with selections announced by November 1st. All eligible buildings must be located within Madison city limits.

Grant funding is available in two categories:
- **Bricks and Mortar Projects**: Including construction, historic window rehabilitation and restoration, repairs to wood siding, masonry, and porches. These projects typically involve significant expenses, and while grants provide assistance, they do not cover the full project cost.
- **Madison Landmark Nominations**: Supporting the designation of historic landmarks within the city.

Additional resources are available:

### June 16, 2025
By Diane Zenz

[Official Minutes](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=M&ID=1236701&GUID=ED3E0BCD-F76B-4DC1-AA31-E50CC0FC45D3)

The Landmarks Commission meeting was called to order at 5:01 p.m. and lasted 13 minutes. The minutes of June 2nd were approved. There were no disclosures or recusals.

The following items were approved on the Consent Agenda:
- Request for **Certificate of Appropriateness** for demolition, new construction, and exterior alteration at **413 S. Brearly Street** in the **Third Lake Ridge Historic District** (District 6) - **[Legistar 88408](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97679)**
- Request for **Certificate of Appropriateness** for new construction at **1717 Kendall Avenue** in the **University Heights Historic District** (District 5) - **[Legistar 88409](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97680)**
- Request for **Certificate of Appropriateness** for an addition at **2113 Kendall Avenue** in the **University Heights Historic District** (District 5) - **[Legistar 88410](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97681)**

#### Demolition and New Construction - 413 S. Brearly Street

**[Legistar 88408](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97679)** - **Certificate of Appropriateness** for demolition, new construction, and exterior alteration at **413 S. Brearly Street** in the **Third Lake Ridge Historic District** (District 6).

The project involves demolishing an existing garage and replacing it with a similar structure. Additionally, repairs will be made to damaged columns and railings on the front porch of the house. The current wood railings are not historic, and the existing garage is a simple, utilitarian structure without historical or architectural significance.

Staff determined that all standards have been met and recommended approval. [Application details with location diagrams](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=14261656&GUID=79C9C2BA-8B0E-4484-9B4A-3FF40B12A73A) and [staff report](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=14288644&GUID=6A71F7FF-ED1A-4701-BF45-714250B31119) are available online.

#### New Construction - 1717 Kendall Avenue

**[Legistar 88409](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97680)** - **Certificate of Appropriateness** for new construction at **1717 Kendall Avenue** in the **University Heights Historic District** (District 5).

The project proposes constructing a new garage on this corner property. The historic home is a Queen Anne-style structure with clapboard siding. The new garage design maintains compatibility with the historic district's character while clearly reading as contemporary and secondary to the historic home.

Staff determined that all standards have been met and recommended approval. [Application with photos](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=14261654&GUID=82D918A3-A789-4CDC-A961-42BFFB4ADBA1) and [staff report](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=14288645&GUID=B9066261-DB8A-4DA6-A68B-DBFA501EEE58) are available online.

#### Addition - 2113 Kendall Avenue

**[Legistar 88410](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97681)** - **Certificate of Appropriateness** for an addition at **2113 Kendall Avenue** in the **University Heights Historic District** (District 5).

The project includes constructing a rear addition to replace a non-historic addition on this 1922 vernacular house, plus adding a new second-story window. The rear addition will feature a slight wall inset to distinguish it from the historic structure, while matching the siding, trim, and window configuration of the original house. However, the proposed second-story window would be highly visible from the public right-of-way and does not meet standards.

Staff recommended approval with the condition that the applicant submit updated drawings removing the proposed second-story window. [Application with diagrams](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=14261646&GUID=D5440A54-8C42-4E4B-A70D-E99CDB8EBA52) and [staff report](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=14288646&GUID=0A2E9CD8-6839-426F-A7DB-186656EB13BB) are available online.

Commissioner Arnesen moved to accept all consent agenda items, seconded by Commissioner Morrison. The motion passed unanimously.

#### Historic Preservation Ordinance Amendment

**[Legistar 88383](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97654)** - **Amendment to Madison General Ordinances Chapter 41** and associated references in Chapters 1, 28, and 31.

This item continued discussions from the April 21, 2025 Special In-Person Meeting regarding updates to historic landmark buildings ordinances. The proposed changes modernize language for clarity and ease of use, including:
- Changing "Certificate of Appropriateness" to "Certificate of Approval"
- Removing the term "Master" in favor of standardized professional terminology
- Revising Computation of Time for Public Notice to 14 days for consistency throughout city ordinances

Commissioner Taylor inquired about public feedback and the dissemination process for these changes. Preservation Planner Heather Bailey reported no public feedback received and confirmed that approved changes will be published in relevant documents and available online following Common Council approval.

The [staff report detailing proposed changes](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=14280568&GUID=D753BD76-4FC3-4863-91D2-5AF33B436084) is available for review.

Commissioner Arnesen moved to recommend approval to Common Council, seconded by Commissioner Morrison. The motion passed unanimously. The meeting then adjourned.


### June 2, 2025
By Diane Zenz

[Official Minutes](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=M&ID=1236700&GUID=8455DE73-55E5-449F-8AAB-15DE8FA9DD0B)

The meeting of the Landmarks Commission was called to order at 5:00 p.m. and lasted 1 hour and 6 minutes. The minutes of the May 19th meeting were approved.

**Public Comments** - This item gives members of the public an opportunity to comment on items that are not on the agenda. There were no comments.

**Disclosures and Recusals** - There were none.

- **Request for Certificate of Appropriateness** for new construction on a designated Madison Landmark site located at **1775 Norman Way** in **District 19** [Legistar 88189](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=88189&GUID=) was moved to the Consent Agenda. Motion made by Jacob Morrison and seconded by Molly Harris to approve the project.

#### Development Adjacent to Mattermore-Malaney House - 501 E. Washington Ave

**[Legistar 88188](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=88188&GUID=)** - **Advisory Recommendation for Development Adjacent to a Designated Madison Landmark**

The Landmarks Commission is an advisory body to the Urban Design and Planning Commissions in this matter as the project is adjacent to the Mattermore-Malaney House landmark at 512 E. Main St (District 6).

Kurt Stege commented positively about the move of the inlet from E. Washington St. to East Main St., believing it made a big difference in the proposal. He informed the Commission of the relationships between the landmark homes in the area and their significance to each other, and wondered what trees would come down and which could stay.

Marc Ott, Nick Orthmann and several other members of the design team were available to speak in support of the project and answer questions.

Heather Bailey, Preservation Planner, provided a summary of the project. The project will redevelop the property at 501 E. Washington to build a 7-story apartment building. This property shares a rear property line with the Mattermore-Malaney House at 512 E. Main St. The Mattermore-Malaney House was designated a Madison landmark in 2002 for its architectural significance as a rare and exceptionally intact example of a frame, Front Gable house. The house, constructed in 1874, is a simple clapboard structure located within the First Settlement local historic district. This area of the neighborhood has a mix of similarly scaled residential structures and larger infill apartment buildings. The landmark home has a deep residential lot (133 feet) with a substantial tree canopy. This tree canopy, along with the inset in the proposed rear wall-plane of the adjacent new structure, creates a visual buffer.

Jacob Morrison and Molly Harris asked the design team if they had considered utilizing setbacks on some of the upper floors of the apartment building to lighten the impact of the height. Marc Ott explained there are some setbacks in certain areas across the upper facade.

Staff recommends to the Landmarks Commission to advise the Plan and Urban Design Commissions that the proposed work will not be so large or visually intrusive as to adversely affect the historic character and integrity of the adjoining landmark.

Jacob made a motion to advise the Urban Design and Planning Commissions that the proposed work will not be so large or visually intrusive that it would adversely affect the historic character and integrity of the adjoining landmark. Motion passed unanimously.

#### Spring Harbor Mound Group - 1775 Norman Way

**[Legistar 88189](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=88189&GUID=)** - **Certificate of Appropriateness for New Construction on a Designated Madison Landmark Site**

The applicant is requesting that the Landmarks Commission approve a Certificate of Appropriateness to make alterations to a designated landmark site in District 19. The proposed project is to build a detached garage on the residential property that is part of a collection of properties within the boundary of the Spring Harbor Mound Group Landmark site. Staff have worked with the property owner to make sure the new garage is located well away from the burial mounds in the area. The Office of the State Archaeologist has approved a Request to Disturb for this project, in compliance with Wisconsin Burial Law. Staff agree with the State that this project is unlikely to disturb the burial mounds and will not have a negative impact on the historic integrity of the site. Staff believe that the standards for granting a Certificate of Appropriateness are met and recommend the project be approved.

#### North-South Bus Rapid Transit - Section 106 Review

**[Legistar 88465](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=88465&GUID=)** - **Section 106 Review for Bus Rapid Transit Project**

The City of Madison is proposing a north-south bus rapid transit (BRT) route affecting Districts 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 18. The project is pursuing funding through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and therefore it must comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and its implementing regulations 36 CFR Part 800. Section 106 requires the consideration of effects to historic properties, which are defined as any district, site, building, structure, or object listed in, or determined eligible for listing in, the National Register of Historic Places. As a result, the bus stations are considered structures that require review by the advisory body.

Heather Bailey gave a brief explanation of the North-South Bus Rapid Transit, explaining that this route and the bus stations are much less concerning from a historical perspective than the East-West route was because the North-South route doesn't run near Historic Districts.

Mike Cechvala, of the Planning Division, explained the project in more detail. The Rapid Route B is Transit's 2nd Bus Transit Rapid Route. It will provide 9.1 miles of new BRT runningway and includes 23 new stations. It is the stations that are of concern to Landmarks.

Katherine Kaliszewski commented that she is one of the Cultural Resource Managers for the Department of Transportation. Although most of her work involves highways, she knows the reviewer for this project and knows she will want to see pictures of the stations with emphasis on detail. She added it is important to be very specific and clear that the stations will be similar but will not all look the same. She noted that the station on Park St. is not labeled as a full reconstruct but it appears it is almost a full reconstruct so it needs to be labeled as such. They also must be clear with the reviewer that potentially minor changes will need to be made along the way.

Staff determines there are no adverse effects on historical properties by the project.

Alder Duncan commented that he would like the project to come back to LMC as a review.

Motion by Molly Harris that Landmarks has no comments at this time and would agree with the determination of no adverse effects on historical properties but would like to remain a consulting party and be notified of any changes that have the potential of impacting historical resources. Motion passed unanimously.

#### Kennedy Road Charging Station - Section 106 Review

**[Legistar 88466](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=88466&GUID=)** - **Section 106 Review for On-Route Charging Station**

Mike Cechvala, of the Planning Division, provided a presentation on the planned on-route charging stations in District 18. These stations will be located at the end of both routes. Currently the bus has to go back to the garage to charge, which is costly and time-consuming.

Installation of the on-route chargers on Northport Drive and Kennedy Rd. is a separate project. The project is in the design stage with construction expected in 2025 and 2026 and planned completion in 2026. The charging connection is overhead and includes a support building.

Staff determines there are no adverse effects on historical properties by the project.

Motion by Molly Harris and seconded by Edna Ely-Ledesma that Landmarks has no comments at this time and would agree with the determination of no adverse effects on historical properties. Motion passed unanimously.

#### Demolition Historic Value Review - 630 E. Washington Ave

**[Legistar 88190](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=88190&GUID=)** - **Consideration of a Demolition Permit to Demolish a Commercial Building**

This building in District 6 was constructed in 1959 as St. Patrick's Roman Catholic School and is described as a simple instructional-type building with little architectural interest. The Landmarks Commission completed a historic value review of this same structure on August 26, 2019, and found it to have no known historic value. The Salvation Army of Dane County is proposing a redevelopment of their current property at 630 E. Washington Avenue. Currently the Salvation Army operates a women and family homeless shelter and services at the site in the former catholic school building. The proposed redevelopment would raze the current building and adjacent parking lots to the east and construct a new purpose-built shelter building. The new shelter will contain expanded capacity for single women and families stays. Additionally, it will provide respite recovery rooms, supportive services including case management, food service, classroom training rooms, multi-purpose space, and recreational space. Also, there will be space for medical primary health, mental health, and dental services to be provided.

Staff recommendation is of no known historic value.

The motion made for a finding of no historical value was made by Jacob Morrison, seconded by Edna Ely-Ledesma. Motion passed unanimously.

The Annual Special Meeting of the Landmarks Commission was held in person and lasted 1 hour and 6 minutes.

Members present: John Duncan (Common Council Member), Jacob Morrison (Registered Architect), Molly Harris (Historian), Maurice Taylor (Licensed Realtor), Edna Ely-Ledesma (Adult City Resident), Richard Arnesen (Adult City Resident), and Katherine Kaliszewski (Adult City Resident). Heather Bailey, Preservation Planner, served as the staff representative.

#### Commission Orientation and SOI Standards Review

**[Legistar 83865](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=92871)** - **Commission Orientation and Parliamentary Procedures**

The meeting began with a brief history and purpose of the Landmarks Commission, followed by an orientation on parliamentary procedures. The commission then reviewed the Secretary of Interior (SOI) Standards.

During the discussion, a commissioner inquired about potential impacts from the Trump administration's policies on the Commission's work. Heather Bailey indicated that several Executive Orders have streamlined federal compliance processes, potentially removing stakeholder involvement from groups like the Commission and State Historical Preservation offices. She noted that if federal standards are eliminated, they may still be applicable if local ordinance language is modified.

Bailey also informed the Commission that staff received notification to halt work on a previously awarded Certifiable Local Government grant. The grant was intended to develop a historic context for public, civic, and commercial architecture from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Since federal funds had not yet been encumbered, the project cannot proceed.

#### Five-Year Review of Historic Preservation Plan

**[Legistar 83866](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=92872)** - **Five-Year Check-in on Madison Historic Preservation Plan**

The Commission reviewed progress on the Madison Historic Preservation Plan, adopted in 2020. The plan is updated every 10 years to ensure the preservation program remains focused and represents Madison's diverse history.

Priority strategies discussed include, but are not limited to:
- Placing plaques at existing buildings and places
- Developing tourism marketing and branding materials highlighting historic attractions
- Coordinating an urban design program to promote city-owned historic buildings and places
- Identifying underrepresented building types in the historic resources inventory
- Developing a "top 10" list of historic buildings and places to preserve
- Encouraging adaptive reuse for affordable housing options

The full plan is available [online](https://www.cityofmadison.com/dpced/planning/documents/Madison%20HPP%20Final%202020.pdf). All projects remain ongoing.

#### Historic Preservation Ordinance Text Amendment

**[Legistar 88167](https://madison.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=97470)** - **Proposed Historic Preservation Ordinance Text Amendment**

Heather Bailey guided commissioners through proposed updates to the Historic Preservation Ordinance. Key changes include clarifying ambiguous language and updating terminology to coordinate with current building permit terminology. A red-lined copy was provided to commissioners and [is available online](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=14145497&GUID=610AE5F3-8FB3-4560-AD5A-3630802AFB08) for public review.

This matter will proceed to the Common Council for approval. Discussion was minimal.

The first item of the night was approving a **landmark nomination** for the **Benjamin and Amy Butts house,** located at **633 East Johnson Street** in **District 6** [Legistar 87159](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7134940&GUID=0E8FFD08-F5B9-43C5-AB4D-06EC4D9243B4&Options=ID|Text|&Search=87159). Staff recommends this property for nomination indicating it meets Criteria A & B. 

Regarding criteria A, the House is associated with the broad patterns of cultural, political, economic, or social history of the nation, state or community. The nomination makes a well-documented case for this property’s association with the early era of Madison’s African-American community. Madison’s Underrepresented Communities Historic Resources Survey identifies this period as spanning from Madison’s first recorded African- American resident in 1839 until the early 20th Century.  The activism and community - building undertaken by the Butts family while they lived at this home had a significant effect on their community as Madison grew.  

With regard to criteria B, Staff indicate it is associated with the lives of important person, and/or with important events in national, state, or local history. The nomination primarily document’s the story of Benjamin Butts, but also includes details of the community activism of Amy Butts.  Both were leaders in Madison, serving as founders for key African-American cultural institutions, such as the St. Paul’s AME Church and the Capital City Lodge #2 of the Prince Hall Masons.  While Amy and Benjamin lived at this home, they took in African-American borders as people moved to Madison to live and work.  They also partnered with other leaders to establish Madison’s first African-American neighborhood located at the  600 block of E. Dayton St. 

While reviewing the substance of the nomination in order to advise the Common Council, the Commission heard from several members of the public. Bob Klebba spoke in support of the nomination. Klebba was also the person who initiated the nomination process. He notes the building came to his attention when a preservation planner suggested this building was worthy of a Landmark Nomination.  The building is not attractive, doesn't have notable architectural features and the inside has been remodeled. It also leans noticeably to the west. What makes this site important is who lived there.   Klebba goes on to say how landmarking this building was made easier than some sites because the history of the people who lived there was already documented. This made it cheaper for the Madison Trust to contract out the work as a lot of the background information was already documented.  Klebba continued, stating how as a voluntary organization it is difficult and too expensive for the Madison Trust to do more than one nomination a year. Klebba “would ask the Commission to keep this in mind when the Madison Trust and other historical preservationists are perceived as acting at the last minute when demolition applications come to the Landmark Commission and on to the Plan Commission.”  Klebba also states a typical nomination cost the Madison Trust between \$3,500 and \$7,500 to complete.  

Joe Lusson and Commissioner Taylor spoke in support as well and stated the owners of the building also support the nomination. Commissioner Taylor added this house is likely to come before the Landmarks Commission again, as it may need some rehab in the future—urging some leeway on these potential rehab needs. 

While Elizabeth Miller was present for questions, there were none and the public hearing was closed. 

Motion recommend to Councial approval of the landmark nomination made by Maurice Taylor, which was seconded by Jacob Morrison before being **passed unanimously.**

#### St. Bernard’s Catholic Church

The next item up for discussion was the request for a **Certificate of Appropriateness** for an addition to St. Bernard’s Catholic Church, a designated Madison landmark located at **2450 Atwood Avenue** in **District 15.** Specifically,the request is to build onto the existing structure in order to construct a crypt.

The location of this addition would be in the courtyard between the church structure and the rectory.  The crypt is proposed as a single-story gabled structure with windows, attached to the church but separated from the historic structure by a smaller addition. The addition will stay with the architectural character of the historic building.  The project also includes replacing an ornamental concrete block privacy wall with a decorative metal fence. Detailed specifications for the fencing and windows for the crypt have not been provided at this time.  

Bradley Servin was available for questions and stated the roof for the crypt will have the same copper roofing of the original church and the same stone veneer.  

Staff believe the standards are met for granting the Certificate of Appropriateness and recommended the Landmarks Commission approve the project with conditions which relate to the specification for the new fencing and window details for the crypt to be approved by staff when available. The item **passed unanimously,** with conditions on the fencing and windows as stated.  

#### Mansion Hill Historic District

The commission shifted their focus to the **combination of land and new construction** at **124 East Gorham Street** in the Mansion Hill Historic District, which resides in **District 2** [Legistar 87103](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7130279&GUID=726ADE85-F867-4C30-B501-98AE1331BE04&Options=ID|Text|&Search=87103).

Joel Koeppen, design leader of Kahler Slater INC,  submitted materials and presented the plans. This included:

 - Existing Structures: The existing Carriage House is a historic resource and is intended to remain on site. The structure is to remain generally intact but reprogramed on the interior. 

 - Proposed Lot Combination: The plan is to combine 124 E. Gorham St. with 116 E. Gorham, of which there is historical precedent. H. Bailey, City Preservation Planner, provided documentation to support this action.

 - Proposed Development: The proposed development consists of a 5 story, 22-unit Multifamily Residential building with subgrade parking.  The existing Carriage House is to be renovated and reprogrammed as a community space and additional units.

The project type is new construction of residential apartments in the Mansion Hill District.  Staff have been working with the property owner on possible options for infill new construction on the property at 124 E. Gorham. This property is currently a gravel parking lot with an 1860’s carriage house on the rear of the site.  While the lot was once part of the adjacent landmarked Brown House property (112 E. Gorham) by the mid - 20th century, it operated as a separate parcel. The project is exploring two options: (1) keeping the lot separate or (2) combining the lot with the adjacent Brown House lot.

Keeping the lot separate with a new residential structure at the front, which would have to comply with Historic District Standards and have review for Development Adjacent to a Landmark. Alternatively, combining with the Brown House lot would require a Certificate of Appropriateness for land combination and the new construction at the front of 124 East Gorham would need to comply with the Secretary of the Interior's Standard for Rehabilitation. 

The informational presentation explored the feasibility of the second option. Staff have concerns about the massing, contextual setback, and architectural character of the proposed new construction. Connecting the new structure to the carriage house will also raise problems with Zoning standards. The historic carriage house needs space so that it is not obscured. If the property is a part of the landmark site, then the new construction will need to look like it belongs to that site, but with significant separation from the historic resources so that the new construction does not overwhelm them.  
 
Commissioner Morrison commented the lot sizes need to be considered and look at comparable structures in the area.  The carriage house connector can be tricky and recommend making the connector look like it could be removed. The lowering of the roof line to 4 stories helps a lot.  Proportion of window space to wall space seems off and makes the windows look small. Similarly, Commissioner Kal stated the porches look too modern and suggests making the front of the building more pronounced and less like a driveway.

Bob Klebba spoke in opposition. Klebba also owns the Governor’s Mansion Inn, a boutique hotel located at 130 East Gillman St. Klebba explained the current Brown House and carriage house resembles the original look of the area with the buildings on the large lots, using historical maps to give the Commision a visual representation. Klebba further complained how neighboring lots have been filled in with 1950’s apartment buildings as well as the 1970’s Verex Plaza building, which provide no context to the National Landmark buildings.

Bruce Bosben of Apex Properties spoke in support his company, as Apex Properties owns the Brown House in addition to the Carriage House and 124 Giillman to the north. Bosben overall owns five buildings listed on the National Registry—which he claims is more historic buildings in Madison than anyone else. He has owned the Carriage House for at least 20 years and would like to build on this lot. 

Commissioner Arnesen stated their belief that the proposed building is too large for the site and crowds out the carriage house. They further voiced concern about brick size for the project, which proposes using a modular size brick rather than a utility size brick. Alternatively, Commissioner Taylor stated he likes the way the building looks and argued the owner is making an effort. 

Alder Latimer Burris mentioned wanting to take a look at the property, stating the proposal is a lot to digest expressing the desire for more time to get additional feedback. She asked whether the Madison Trust has weighed in at all, to which Heather Bailey responded the Madison Trust has not weighed in, but the Commission will hear from them when an actual application is completed. 

Commissioner Harris spoke on how the Carriage House is not designated a Historical site, only the Brown house—drawing attention to how the primary consideration at hand is the new construction.

Koeppen thanked the Commission for their input and comments before stating they will continue to work towards a design that will meet the needs of the city while maintaining the integrity of the historical significance of the area. 

#### 2604 Waunona Way

Proposed **demolition** of buildings located at **2604 Waunona Way** in **Distract 14** was also on the evening’s agenda [Legistar 86033](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7018190&GUID=E100353D-F94B-42DD-8568-E51B450CDFF4&Options=ID|Text|&Search=86033). Having been built between 1901 and 1902, Staff recommended a finding of historical value related to vernacular architecture; however, the building itself is not historically significant. This property is also located within the boundary of the Waunona Mounds site and any ground-disturbing activity would need to secure a Request to Disturb from the Wisconsin State Archaeologist and notify the Ho-Chunk National Tribal Historic Preservation Office.

The commission determined there is no historical value to the home, but acknowledged the Waunona Mounds site and the need to secure a Request to Disturb. A motion was made to approve and **unanimously passed.**

#### Short Items

With the meeting nearing a close, the Commission quickly reviewed historical value for **6105 South Highland Avenue**  and **2326 Vondron Drive**.

Although 6105 South Highland Avenue is a single family home built in 1875, Staff recommended no historic value. Similarly, 2326 Vondron Road was not recommended to have historic value as it was built in 2000. Notably, 2326 Vondron suffered a fire, which has lead the Madison Fire Department to submit a request to demolish the commercial building.

The Commission agree with Staff, and a motion finding no historic value was **unanimously passed.**

#### Secretary’s Report Highlights

The Secretary’s Report then reminded the Commission the new demolition process went into effect March 9, 2025, but the Landmarks Commission will still see all demolition applications.






### February 10, 2025

By Diane Zenz

[Official Minutes](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=M&ID=1236696&GUID=CCBBAC36-BD14-45FA-99F4-EFA7379F02BD)

On Monday night, the City of Madison’s Landmarks Commission met to discuss several proposals and items: a proposed amendment to the Lamp House Report, a development adjacent to an established historical building, and additions to historic districts. Among the consent agenda:

 - [Legistar 86590](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7083905&GUID=1C14B4D8-A64F-4977-A5FB-35B775A0D772&Options=ID|Text|&Search=86590): **Land Combination/Division** at **1937 Arlington Place** and **2013-2021 Chamberlain Ave** in the University Heights Historic District located in **District 5**
 - [Legistar 86668](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7087048&GUID=67D752B6-921B-44D5-A340-DBC7E8588360&Options=ID|Text|&Search=86668): An **addition to a Designated Madison Landmark,** namely St. Bernard’s Catholic Church, located at **2450 Atwood Ave** in **District 15** 

#### Amending the 2013 Report of the Lamp House Block Ad Hoc Plan Committee [Legistar 86824](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7252915&GUID=C3767CD2-F2F0-4942-A46A-54DD4D55D7BD&Options=ID|Text|&Search=86824).

The Lamp House is a Frank Lloyd Wright building situated two blocks northeast of the Capitol.  It was built in 1903 and is the oldest Wright building in Madison.  It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.  The mid-block location (unique among Wright’s works) is bound by East Washington, Mifflin, Webster, and Butler Streets.  It is only accessible from Butler Street via a narrow, ascending driveway on a right of way between two homes. The keyhole lot then opens up, producing a compression/ release dynamic encountered frequently in Wright's works. Although completely landlocked, the home originally provided viewscapes comparable to lakefront residential buildings. It has always been surrounded on all four sides by residential buildings and although the southern viewshed towards Lake Monona has been cut off by a high-rise on the adjacent lot and the westward view toward the Capitol was blocked by new construction in 2015, the penthouse enclosure (added on the roof) still has a view of Lake Mendota to the North and west.  This three story building has exposed basement windows and a rooftop garden.

Ald. Bennett made a request to Council to amend the [Report of the Lamp House Block Ad Hoc Plan Committee](https://www.cityofmadison.com/dpced/planning/documents/Amended_Report_Lamp_House_3-11-25.pdf) to remove or change some of the recommendations to restrict building heights around the Lamp House. Although Common Council later decided not to restrict building heights in existing plans, the recommendations in the Lamp House report have a status similar to city plans and so may restrict development.  Landmark’s role is advisory only and the issues at hand consist of viewing to and from the Lamp House and Reference to Building Height. 

The first proposed change to the initial report of 2013 focuses on which views should be prioritized for preservation (Page 3 of staff report). The report assesses View 1 (North Butler Street) should be preserved, whereas Views 2 and 3 (East Mifflin Street) should be preserved if feasible. The feasibility of preserving Views 2 and 3 should be determined by the Plan Commission during the review of a development proposal, subject to Common Council approval in the case of a planned development. View 4 has been partially accommodated in a redevelopment project undertaken after the adoption of this report. 

The second proposed change (page 4 of staff report) focuses on the maximum building heights in the downtown plan as adopted in 2012 and subsequently incorporated into the zoning code. In summary, this would eliminate Lamp House viewscape restrictions in the area that effectively restrict buildings to 3 stories. 

Alder Bennet (who made the requested change) spoke in support of preserving the Lamp House viewscapes, but stated if the requested changes are not made, 452 properties in her district can not be developed above three stories. Alder Bennet also stated she loves the Lamp House and the views are amazing, but we should be able to build houses and preserve history at the same time.  She additionally indicated she has developers contacting her all the time. 

Nan Fay - who spoke in opposition- believes there is no need to make changes to the current plan. Alternatively, Bruce Bosban (of Apex Property Management - developer and landlord in Madison) spoke in support of the  changes. He stated he is one of the largest providers of natural affordable housing in Madison, owning 2,000 units in the city with the majority renting to low income families. Bosben informed the committee he has been buying old buildings to restore and renovate for over 40 years, owning five buildings on the National Register of Historic Places including the Lamp House. Last year, Bosben spent over $12 million  restoring buildings that are over 100 years old and has also been involved in new development—having completed five developments in the last five years. Bosdan would like to build smaller efficiency units that will be priced as low income, as well as market priced buildings. The Lamp House complained that he “can’t get a plan past Staff in Planning” due to the low building height requirements and argued lower story buildings are not financially possible.  There was a bit of a back and forth between Bosban and the chair of the Landmark Commission in regard to his statement that he doesn’t take TIF money or historic tax credits to build. The chair asked “is that because you don’t want to have to follow the standards?” In a  sarcastic tone, the chair asked if he needed help getting that information.  Finally,  Alder Bennet asked if this questioning of Historic Tax Credits was relevant to the question at hand.  The chair continued to explain her rationale for the questions until Staff Heather Bailey broke in to say that the line of questioning was out of order.

Commissioner Maurice Taylor asked Bosdan how many buildings he was planning to raze. Bosban replied with his goal of four buildings that face Mifflin Street and one that faces Butler Street, with about 50 units each. At this point the chair reminded the commission it was not their role to ask about future projects.

Kurt Stegge spoke in opposition, stating that the proposal is rewriting history. No one should add to a report done over a decade ago. Linda Lenards further voiced opposition, claiming the changes will impinge on views and if this change is made there will only be one view down a 12 foot wide alley.  Alex Saloutos then urged the committee to not make the proposed changes, stating the Staff report does not address compliance of the proposed changes with the city’s historic preservation plan and their impact on this site. Saloutos further claimed the change fails to analyze the impact of the proposed changes of the Lamp House site.

Their statements were echeod by Robert Klebba, a well known preservationist with the Madison Historical Trust. Klebba urged Landmarks to not approve the amendment because the Lamp House is the only urban Frank Lloyd Wright site and mentioned there is already a plan for this block. Klebba boasted that it is an exceptional property.  The argument to make this block conform to city wide zoning so that Planning’s job is easier flies in the face of having a special plan for this block and for this landmark. Klebba argued conformity is not more important than preservation. Alder Bennet then mentioned working with the Lamp House’s property owner to develop natural occurring affordable housing in order to build market rate housing at significantly higher rental cost, which will decrease affordable housing options. 

After much discussion a motion was made to return the request to LEAD with the Recommendation to **Place on File without Prejudice** to the Plan Commission. **The motion passed unanimously.** 

#### Repealing and recreating Section 28.185 and creating Section 41.28 of the Madison General Ordinances related to demolition of buildings to update the approval process [Legistar 86649](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7139916&GUID=08ED78F9-21E9-4625-A20C-4A9C0AA97459&Options=ID|Text|&Search=86649).

The Landmarks Commission currently sees all requests for demolition to determine historical value then the application goes to the Planning Commission where a Public Hearing is held before being either approved or denied.  

Under the proposed process, all applications will still go to the Landmarks Commission first. If the building is determined to have “Historical Value” or is a “Regrettable Loss” it will continue in the normal fashion on to the Plan Commission; however, if a determination is made that the building has no historical value, the application will bypass the Plan Commission and the Public Hearing—going directly to city staff, where the approval will be issued administratively. 

In the proposed change, it is required that all materials provided to the Landmark Commission be provided to the Planning Commission.  

**Proposed (MGO 28.185)**

Two Standards must be met: Demolition aid plan implementation or purpose statement. According to the proposal, “what outweighs preservation may include, but not be limited to, conditions (including  city reports on the same), loss of historical features, plans for mitigating the impact of the lost building.” The Statement of Purpose was an area that the Landmarks Commission had a lot of conversations and concerns with.



Based on the data provided:

 - 74% of buildings approved for demolition have No Known Historical Value.
 - 18% of buildings approved for demolition have a determination of Regrettable Loss.
 - 9% of buildings approved for demolition have a determination of Historical Value.

Eleven people from the community spoke against the proposed change. They expressed concerns over the possibility of lost property to demolitions and that this will have a sweeping impact on preservation. There was a discussion about adding language regarding the importance of archaeological value.

A motion was made to **recommend approval of the revised language** in the historic preservation ordinance with the addition of language regarding archaeology under historic value Criterion C (No Historic Value). The landmarks Commission requested that Common Council re-refer the item to the Landmarks Commission in order to have sufficient time to review the zoning section of the ordinance. **The motion passed unanimously.** 

#### 1 South Ingersol Street

The Plan Commission continued their meeting, moving their focus to **development adjacent to a designated Madison landmark** at the Gisholt Machine Co. Manufacturing Complex at 1301 East Washington Avenue [Legistar 86671](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7087063&GUID=32E195CA-F599-42CA-90D7-DD96947E85A6&Options=ID|Text|&Search=86671). The historic property in question: **1 South Ingersoll St.** in **District 6.** Proposed work is fairly extensive, including: 

 - Construct new rear addition
 - Replace non historic windows
 - Masonry Repair
 - Site work
 - The site is connected to the Madison Metro Bus Barn
 - There will be a facade change
 - Rehab it back to its former historic look
 - Add a bright colored mural
 - Sawtooth area on roof (will not be seen)

A motion was made and the request was **approved unanimously.**

#### Mackenzie House

The committee reviewed the National Register of Historic Places **nomination** for the Mackenzie House, located at **2525 Marshall Parkway** in **District 13** [Legistar 86953](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7126128&GUID=D509F9AD-62AB-4A39-817F-B782CA638A04&Options=ID|Text|&Search=86953). Not only does the home have distinctive architecture, but there is also an archaeological site on the property.

The nomination was supported by the Landmarks Commission, who will submit comments as the certified local government to the State Preservation Review Board and National Park Service.  A motion made and the **passed unanimously.**

#### University Heights Historic District

The commission also discussed an **addition** proposal in the University Heights Historic District, specifically **2006 Van Hise Avenue** in **District 5** [Legistar 86669](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7087049&GUID=3AD994DC-FA6A-4A18-ABAA-13EA1B703A52&Options=ID|Text|&Search=86669). After reviewing the Certificate of Appropriateness for the Mediterranean revival style home, which was constructed in 1924, the Commission went over the proposed work. This includes the construction of a new rear addition, replacement of non-historic windows, masonry repair, and miscellaneous site work. Ultimately, the Commission **approved** the proposal.
