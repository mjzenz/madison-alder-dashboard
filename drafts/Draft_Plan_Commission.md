#### Electric Generator for Green Tree Landfill

Item 11 of the night focused on [Legistar 87469](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7249848&GUID=7B2932B3-5397-4B49-87A1-16416F7BA8F2): **Conditional use** in the **Conservancy (CN) District** to allow for the installation and use of an emergency electric generator at the Greetree Landfill, located at **6802 Hammersley Road** in **District 20.**  Staff reviewed the proposal, noting the site is currently supported by one gas generator. The new electric generator is set to be installed on a pad directly next to the current unit, which sits 140 feet from the nearest residence. The emergency generator pad would be roughly five feet closer and is expected to run 20 hours a year total. The run time estimate is based on one hour a month for maintenance on the gas generator (twelve hours total) and power outages that would stop the existing unit’s pump and halt operation (expected eight hours a year, but would be weather dependent).

Jay McLellan, a district resident, voiced concern over the need for the generator and their confusion surrounding communications sent out by City Engineering. McLellan stated they received a postcard last week with notice of tonight’s meeting, but no information on why an additional generator was slated to be installed at the landfill. This was concerning, as the location has a history of danger, with McLellan referencing the explosion of a home on Hammersley Road in the 1980’s as a result of gasses escaping the landfill. They had no issues with views or noise that would be caused by the new unit, but rather safety and how the need was assessed.

Jack Brody, present to answer questions on behalf of the City’s Engineering division, was unable to answer Alder Harrington-McKinny’s follow-up inquiry on improving communications with residents; however, Brody gave further insight to the need for the generator. Going off of Alder Guequierre’s questioning of current City protocol, Brody confirmed the City dispatches mobile generators when needed. This can be problematic, as there are only two units available, which other entities such as the Madison Fire Department often request to use. Shared use is in addition to generators needing to be transported by staff, which can be difficult during flooding and winter storms. Brody acknowledged the safety concerns, and highlighted the Greentree Landfill as having the highest potential for explosion—furthering the need for the electric back-up. Currently, the City will not allow the generator to be down more than four hours at a time due to gas build-up and potential leaks. In the event of an outage, the landfill can be allowed to sit without a running generator for up to 24 hours before becoming a major safety concern, although letting it sit that long is not ideal. Brody clarified the generator would come out of Engineering’s budget, not the City’s.

The item **passed** with unanimous approval from the plan commission.

#### Additional Park-and-Ride Lot for the University of Wisconsin-Madison

[Legistars 87471](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7249866&GUID=C84FAF01-E6A2-4713-B787-08676CD4B989) and [87475](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7249935&GUID=6CE0EA40-F16E-4286-AAF8-B920C465261E)
 both concerned additional parking for UW—the former being for **conditional use in an Industrial-Limited (IL) District** and the later for **approving a certified survey map** of a property owned by Madison Square Storage, LLC. in order to make way for a parking lot located at **2230 Pennsylvania Avenue** in **District 12.**

Commissioner Mendez recused themselves from voting, as their employment with the University is ties directly to this project. Alder Field and Commissioner McCahill also disclosed their employment with UW-Madison, but stated it would not impact their votes.

Staff once again presented, going over the proposed use for the lot. UW offers [park and ride options for employees](https://transportation.wisc.edu/commuter-solutions/park-and-ride/) Monday through Friday, with charter buses running every 20 minutes during peak times and every 30 minutes during off-peak hours. The current plan would be to extend this option to the public on specific weekends for high-traffic events that expect to fill current parking allowances. The proposal includes 229 parking spaces, two motorcycle spots, and several bike slots for cyclists. Overall, Staff recommended approving the plan as they do not believe it will inhibit further development.

William Butcher, representing the developer working with the University to establish the park and ride, was questioned by the Commission on the plan’s inclusion of four electric vehicle spaces. Butcher acknowledged this is the minimum set forth by the City; however, they are currently reworking the plan to increase that number to 20–possibly 23. Butcher says they are more than amenable to exceeding the four spots, it is simply a matter of input and electrical planning. Butcher also took a moment to highlight how the proposal would help alleviate traffic congestion and automobile emissions, all while increasing parking availability downtown due to less use by employees and visitors to the University.

Discussion emerged surrounding how UW decided on the location in question, to which Butcher did not know the specifics. He was able to say he understood UW had done their due diligence, taking into consideration access to public transit, commute time from the lot to campus, and the location falling outside of the primary downtown areas with the highest need for additional housing. Aside from those items, he could not say why or how the University settled on this particular site. Butcher added that several neighborhood associations in the area had been contacted, as well as district Alder Latimer Burris, and based on responses their was no need to hold a public hearing regarding the proposed development.

Commissioner Heck specifically asked if this would be a free or paid parking option. Butcher, being with the developer and not UW Transportation, did not know. Commissioner Mendez did not contribute to the conversation or provide additional information regarding UW-Madison's planned use of the lot, despite being the [Director of Transportation Operations](https://transportation.wisc.edu/about/#leadership).

This author examined the issue and found there are no free parking options available to University employees. Other park and ride options are available [but require a permit](https://transportation.wisc.edu/rates-and-policies/rates/) can be seen on the UW Transportation website for anyone interested in a more comprehensive answer on expected fees associated with using the lot. Commissioner Heck further questioned why the model is not closer to what we have seen for EPIC employees, with further lots from EPIC’s campus and a central drop-off location. While Butcher is not aware of the logistics, Transportation’s website also shows multiple stops on campus which get employees closer to their office location.

Stemming from questioning from Commissioners McCahill and Heck, Butcher did disclose the University is placing pressure on the developer to have the project complete by the end of the Summer, likely for the start of the Fall semester and football season, and that the lease would be for 15 years. Commissioner Heck asked staff if they were allowed to limit the conditional use to five years and reassess at a later date based on housing needs, which staff responded yes. This prompted Commissioner Wasniewski to ask staff if this proposal fit into the City Plan. Staff drew attention to the location’s current zoning as being industrial and containing a generous amount of warehouses. As such, staff believe it conforms to the current City Plan.

While Commissioners Heck and McCahill did so begrudgingly—finding it difficult to approve a parking lot instead of housing—the items **both passed unanimously.**

#### Secretary’s Report

Secretary Tuttle corrected a statement from the March 17th meeting, clarifying tonight’s congregation was the final meeting with current sitting Alders, not March 17th. Although Wisconsin just held an election April 1st, which included the Alder race on Madison ballots, the newly elected alders have yet to be sworn in and assigned to their respective committees. Tuttle once again thanked everyone for their participation, preparation, and contributions as members of the Plan Commission.

Tuttle also drew attention to several development highlights from this past year, including the approval of just over three thousand multi family homes, 161 new single family homes, and 134 lots for two-family residences. This is in addition to approving over 700 preliminary lots for further housing developments. While this is a decline from previous years, it is similar to numbers seen in 2021 and the Plan Commission continues to see a promising, steady stream of applications to further housing, plats, and conditional use within the City of Madison.



### 2025-3-17, Tuesday 5:30pm

The March 3, 2025 Plan Commission Meeting was short and sweet, with most of the items being passed or placed on file without prejudice as part of this week’s consent agenda. Although Alder Field, along with Commissioners McCahill and Mendez, disclosed their affiliation with the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Commissioner Mendez was the only member to abstain from voting on the 210 Bernard Court demolition, as Mendez has direct involvement with the project. Alder Field and Commissioner McCahill stated for the record they are not involved in the request and their employment status at the University would not impact their votes.

The consent agenda consisted of six items total, three of which were passed unanimously and three of which were placed on file without prejudice.

#### Items Passed Unanimously:
 - Consideration of a **demolition permit** to demolish a three-family residence at **210 Bernard Court** in District 8 [Legistar 87142](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7132213&GUID=2B6DEF88-0E50-4B80-A082-81097F6BB520&Options=ID|Text|&Search=87142).

#### Items Placed on File without Prejudice:

 - [Placed on file due to being withdrawn:] consideration of **conditional use** in the Commercial Corridor-Transitional (CC-T) District to convert a restaurant-tavern to a restaurant-nightclub located at **1025 N Sherman Avenue** in District 12 [Legistar 87144](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7132352&GUID=84E49B93-59B2-4E09-B754-C106EB796649&Options=ID|Text|&Search=87144).
 - [Developer has withdrawn demolition application:] consideration of a **demolition permit** to demolish a mixed-use building, including an apartment and restaurant located at  **77 Sirloin Strip** in District 14 [Legistar 86732](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7090673&GUID=41EC58A4-DA53-489F-A046-F74231A87709&Options=ID|Text|&Search=86732).
 - [Proposed conditional use cannot proceed due to demolition application being withdrawn:] Consideration for **conditional use** in the [proposed] Traditional Residential-Urban 1 (TR-U1) District for a multi-family dwelling with greater than 60 units to allow for construction of a 74-unit apartment building located at **77 Sirloin Strip** in District 14 [Legistar 86733](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7090695&GUID=5C8228FD-4303-48D7-9B50-E10BF02A0A43&Options=ID|Text|&Search=86733).

#### Jay’s, 406 North Frances Street, Conditional Use

[Legistar 87143](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7132351&GUID=DC8B2828-BC5C-48FC-A9C7-3A813CE0FEFC&Options=ID|Text|&Search=87143)

The only item up for discussion was consideration for conditional use in an Urban Mixed-Use (UMX) District for a nightclub at Jay’s in District 2, located at 406 North Frances Street. Staff Chris Wells presented, reviewing the applicant’s request for approval to operate the proposed nightclub out of an existing tavern. The owner, Jay Wanserski, joined the public hearing via telephone to gain clarity on the closed doors condition and how that impacted the ability for their establishment to utilize garage doors that open sections of the building wall to allow for additional airflow in the warmer months. The public hearing initially closed following Wanserski’s speaking time allotment; however, Commissioner Heck asked staff if the Plan Commission had authority over conditions set in the approval. Staff confirmed the commission could alter conditions, citing the 2022 approval for Red Rock Saloon’s application with a condition allowing Red Rock to keep their similarly styled garage doors open until midnight. In order to gain a better understanding of the owner’s plans for operating the night club, a movement was made to reopen the public hearing.

Commissioner Heck led the discussion with Wanserski, clarifying that live music would end before midnight or the garage doors must be shut. It was agreed Jay’s may keep their garage doors open when music is coming from their jukebox, with Wanserski noting that most performers end their sets before midnight. Wanserski further noted any music played from the jukebox after midnight is typically quieter due to fewer patrons filtering in and out during the hours leading up to bar time. Ultimately, Commissioner Heck moved to amend the conditions to meet Wanserski’s request and the change passed. This was immediately followed by the Plan Commission’s approval of the application for conditional use.

#### Closing Remarks

Closing out the meeting, Secretary Tuttle mentioned a three week break in meetings and heavier agendas coming next month due to the April 1st election and Alder turnover. Along with providing updates regarding 77 Sirloin Strip from the Common Council Meeting, Secretary Tuttle also noted the Lamphouse substitute was adopted by the Madison Alders. The Commission adjourned, with the next meeting scheduled for Monday, April 7th.
